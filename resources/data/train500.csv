000d118,"Many people have car where they live. The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen like you can get in accidet or the smoke that the car has is bad to breath on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely ""car free"" but If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called ""smart planning"". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that ""All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change"" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called ""car reduced""communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.    ",3
000fe60,"I am a scientist at NASA that is discussing the ""face"" on mars. I will be explaining how the ""face"" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.

First off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.

Next, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?

Finaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the ""face"" is just a landform.

To sum all this up the ""face"" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.",3
001ab80,"People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.

Currently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely ""driverless"". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the ""driverless"" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely ""driverless"". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more ""fun"", driving is not meant to be ""fun"" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have ""fun"" is just a recipe for disaster.

The idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.

The technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.         ",4
001bdc0,"We all heard about Venus, the planet without almost oxygen with earthquakes, erupting volcanoes and temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit but what if scientist project the futur into this planet ? Through this article, the author uses evidences appealing to reason and concession to make us realize why we should care about studying this planet so that people must give a chance to Venus.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density and size but has a really different climate. As it is evoked by the author:

( 3) ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus’s atmosphere. On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit....Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" The author uses of concession tell us what is the actual climate of Venus. He tell us the truth, he support the fact that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit but he also recognize that there's a danger present continuously. And because he support the idea of studying Venus, he proposes ways to study the planet and find a solution at a reasonable distance.

Venus is an inhospitable planet that can almost be considered as an impossible dwelling for humans. But for the author, that can't keep scientist to do their job (studying Venus) : (5) ""NASA’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Through this evidence, appealing to reasonning, the author talk about the NASA's possible solution to raise his credibility. But also, to convince the audience that we can only find a solution by studying the planet.

In conclusion, despite of Venus hostility put in advance by the concession, the author makes the audience realize that there's a solution but that we can find it only if we study the planet. He make us find out that challenge and curiosity is part of human life. But also that danger and fear should not stop us from discovering new things. After all, we are Humans.",4
002ba53,"Dear, State Senator

This is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.""There are many reasons to keep the Electoral College"" one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College because,it is widely regarded as an anachronism. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).

Another, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Last but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state. But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election.

3E+087,"If I were to choose between keeping the electoral college or abolishing it, I would chose for abolishing it. The electoral college has a system that can be considered confusing to most americans. This system indirectly transfers citizen's votes to congress. This allows for loopholes and sabaotage to be commited during the process of electing a president.

I propose abolishing the electoral college and replacing it with a simpler system that appeals to all united states citizens instead of just certain citizens. Based on phrases in the passage, there is evidence that the electoral college system is corrupt. An example would be:

Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

-source 2, second paragraph.

This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.

Votes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states. In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win.

You may think that the votes could be sabotaged, and that politicians could put in fake votes and get rid of real ones. This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped.

I propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated. This would be a less confusing system that could make voting more efficient.            ",4
33037,"The posibilty of a face reconizing computer would be very helpful for children or even adults. Its would be helpful in a ways of satifying our needs and why showing us thing that would make going on the internet better.

I think that the face reconizing computer would be very reliable; because in the text its says "" A class room computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored"". And if the students is ""confused and bored"" then the students is not really learning anything, beacuse all children can't be taught the same way. Some children have trouble learning or its harder for those children to learn; in a result of failing grades and low participation happening in the classroom.

In my conclusion I think that face reconizing computers would the best thing for students. In way if a students were to not understand what her/she is learning in class the face reconizing computer could realize that the child doesn't understand is and give more instructions on what to do for the topic or assingment the're doing.",2
0033bf4,"What is the Seagoing Cowboys progam?

It was to help many countries that had been scarred by World War II.

These people helped with cattle and other animals that were shipped to Europe to help them.

People were asked to help by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or UNRRA.

People should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam because, you get to help other countries and people, you get to see many parts of the world, and you have fun.

If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys progam, you can help other countries by giving them animals for food and work.

It makes you feel good about yourself.

The article says, "" It made me more aware other countries and their needs.""

That would make someone feel good about themselves for helping other countries.

Wouldn't that make you feel good?

In the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can see many parts of the world depending on where you are going.

You could see Italy and other countries.

The article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

That would be very exciting.

How would you like to see a bunch of different countries while working?

You wouldn't have to pay for travel

While working for this program, you would also have fun.

The people aboard the ship would play games on the way back to get more animals.

The cowboys would also play baseball and other games in empty ship holds where the animals were on the way there. Also the article even states that they played games.

Even though you are working, you will still have fun.

So, if you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will have fun, you will feel good about yourself, and you will also get to tour and visit many different parts of the world.

Many people helped with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

They helped many countries in Europe.

The cowboys still got to do what they always did, help with animals.

So, do you think that you would want to become a Seagoing Cowboy?

Or at least be in the program.  ",3

You'd be helping our country because when Luke was in seagoing cowboy program it was 1945 and world war 2 was happening in Europe and he had to those countries recover. Luke had to help the horses when the war was over to get people places and to work. If you were 18 or up you might be lucky and be drafted into the military service. The UNRRA would hire seagoing Cowboys to feed the horses cows and mules that were shipped overseas.

You'd be traveling around they world like Luke did. It took Luke 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast. You'd be traveling to China, Europe, Greece, and many more places. The only way you'd be good at this job is if you wouldn't get sea sick because if you are a seagoing cowboy told travel overseas a lot.

If the car doesn't know a person is j walking it could run over the person and possibly kill them, and yes j walking is illegal but it still happens. Finally i don't think these computers are a good idea because of malfunction. If something goes wrong in the car or the brakes go out it can lead to death for the passenger.

005a72e,"I agree that driverless cars are a developing idea. I do like the fact that these cars should be used by the public. They could lead us to a whole other revolutionary idea with the way the human race lives our lives. It could help us all out with our neccessaties. Also it could help us with other sciences in our lives such as medical assisstants and drivers. Next, the ability to drive without a driver could help us alll in the aspect of the way on how we live our lives.

First, for example in the text paragraph 7 it says how the company of BMW has made the ""Trafiic Jam Assisstant"" which could help us drive up to 25 mph without the need to do anything at all. Driverless cars dont just help us at drving it helps us at being smarter. The science put into these cars to drive without any work is fascinating. If we could put that same science in other fields justy as medical, then the possibilites are endless. We could have assisstant doctors getting us tools that we need,when we need them, and alarming us when something is wrong.

Next, these cars are fantastic for elderly people who are unable to drive by themselves. They offer a sugnificant amount of assisstants for them so they dont have to rely on anyone else. Next, it could help keep us safe in our cars. For example, in the article in paragraph 7 it also states that these new cars have developed a drivers seat that ""vibrates"" when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. These cars can reduce the amount of vehicle incidents very much. Not only can they stop us from backing in to something but they can also stop us from being killed.

After that, they have video cameras also in every corner of the car to help the driver sense any danger around them. For Instance, in parapraph 4 they tell of how they have a ""spinning sensor on the roof that uses laser beams to form a constantly updated 3-d model of the car and it's surrounding. They need all of these so it could act as if a human being was in the driver's seat. Further more, these ""newer cars"" dont just give us new abilities, but also the new knowledge. They show us what needs improvement and what doesn't. Also, they help us guide our way to safety if we are lost.

To inculde, these cars could also lead us to anywhere we need. This is very important in case someone gets lost. For example, if someone is lost on a camping trip and is in the wrong spot there and needs assisstance, then there car could lead then to safety and tell them exactly where they are located. It could also serve as a discovery unit. For instance, if someone is in a new town or city then they need to know where the gas station, hotel, restaurant, etc are and there car would take them there. They would help them navigate to whereever there destination might be.

In conclusion, the need for cars that do not need a driver is very important to our everyday lives. They would help navigate, save, and make our lives easier. They would help our economy out tremendoulsy by reducing accidents and the death rate. Next, they would help with people who need it such as elderly and disabled people. Last, these cars are getting closer and closer to becoming a part of our daily lives already, because we have the science that helped us develop these types of cars now.",4
613000,"The election should be by popular vote of the citizens not by government hired official with some group name to make them sound important.

The electoral colledge is just a way for the people running for president to get votes that they do not deserve. There are 538 electors in the electoral colledge and that means that that is 538 votes that may or may not have gone in favor of the person that the people wanted for president. Out of the 538 elecors they only need 270 votes to elect a president. Why not let the people (who go through tougher times than government officials) get the votes to elect the president. Each candidate that is running for president has their own group of electors who would rather vote for their candidate so they can get a big fat paycheck, instead of actually sitting down and trying to decide who is the most qualified to run this country. There are others who think like me too, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election instead of having suck up electors who don't even think about the people of the country. They do what they do best. Do you wnt to know what it is? They are suck ups for the candidate from their state (or to whomever has the most money).

There are some people who are going to say that the electoral colledge is a good way to elect our president and I understand that.

The electoral colledge might be a good thing because it consists of qualified government hired officials instead of everyday commoners like us. The electoral colledge was put into the Constitution so it must be worth something. Every state has their own candidate and with him are his electors, the best politicians that the government could hire for this job from that state. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the president and some people might be like HEY!, that is 270 votes that we dont have to do. The electoral colledge might also be a good thing for people who don't care about who runs the country.

If this country was founded on freedom, don't we have the freedom, no, don't we have the right to vote for who runs this country. Not suck up politicians. We should vote for our President!     ",3
0065bd6,"Driverless cars should not exsist it can cause many accidents and possibly can result into death. I believe that driverless cars should not exsist because it can be dangerous to not just one person but for everyone.

Lets say you have a driverless car and sensors stopped working and you didn't know that, right there can cause a huge accident, just because the sensors stopped working.Or lets say you do get into an accident driving a driverless car who's fault would it be? We don't know. The text states in paragraph 9, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture?"" People need to know who's fault it would be if they are driving a driverless car and get into an accident and possibly get injured.

There is no point of having a driverless car if it is not completely driverless. In paragraph 7 it states that, ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" It also states that, ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" What if the person using the driverless car isn't paying attention to the notification sign, or what if a person falls asleep and didn't hear the notification sign then what?

In paragraph 9 it states, ""Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" I completely agree with that statement because with a driverless car what if it loses control you won't be able to do anything about it because you are not in control of it, but with a person driving,

that person has100% control of what ever happens.          ",3
0066c7c,"My position on driveless cars are bad because i don't trust them. I have a couple reasons why i don't trust them. My first reason is accidents. Driveless cars could have a sytem malfunction and drive off course and something breaks and crash into somthing. This could happen to anyone such as police, buses, and simple pedestrians.

My second reason is too many driveless cars. If there were to make way too many drivless cars then it would alot of traffic because there are alot of cars who need a driver to drive. Such as if they were to go to the junk yard the junk yards would overflow and they would have to make more and more and less places to build houses or less crops for farmers.

My last reason is pollution. If aot of people bought all these driveless cars then so much pollution would comeup and take over the sky and people would get sick and die from breathing in the air. If they were to change gas into something else and something went wrong with the gas or something to run the cars, they would either blow up or cause to much pollution that they would have to refund all the people and people would stop buying these because they wouldn't trust them.

006c931,"What if we could tell how all of the people us were without even asking. Most people can tell when someone is sad, happy, or mad just by looking at them, but what happens when that person is hiding how they are truely feeling. What then? Well new techonlogy can allow us to see exctly how someone, who is trying to hide there emotions, is feeling. This is unfair for many reasons. The technology may be cool but people have a right to keep how they are feeling a secert.

The computer software works by making a 3-D computer model of the face; the computer watches the different muscles in the face move to identify how the person is feeling. The technolgy delevopted by Dr. Huang can even calculate mixed emotions with the exact percent of how strong the emotions are. Dr. Huang obseres that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" I htought people expressed emotions in different ways though? Dr Hoang also states that ""even though individuals often show verying degrees of expression.""

People have a right to not tell people how they are feeling. Did we really need to know the Mona Lisa was 9 percent disgusted? Now that raises the question of why? Was Leonardo de Vinci's hair messed up? Or did she think he needed to take a shower? What is the point in knowing someone is feelings without knowing why? We do not need technology to ask someone how they are feeling. or even why the are feeling the way they are feeling that way.

There are really no benfits to knowing how someone is feeling without knowing why. The technology is very cool. It is crazy how Dr Huang was able to develope a computer that uses muscle movment to idenitfy emotions. The technology is useless though unless you are prepare and willing to ask why? ",3
006d0e1,"Have you ever seen Europe? What about China, or the Acropolis in Greece? Have you seen Venice, Italy, or the Panama Canal? If you've ever wanted to do those things, and help a lot of people while doing it, you're Seagoing Cowboy material. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of the hard work it teaches, the experience, and because you're supporting other countries, as well as your own!

First of all, we have the grueling hard work to speak of. Some may say that grueling hard work is not a reason to volunteer for something, but I disagree. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is nothing like a normal, boring life. Yes, you have hard work, but you get the greatest sense of satisfaction once you're done. You get to know that all your hard work has gone to helping people in need, and that you've really made a mark on this world. I think hard work is also the path to knowledge, and you may just learn some life lessons along the way.

Secondly, the fantastic experience is what we will cover. Some people may argue that the experience isn't worth risking your life over, but in reality, it's quite the contrary. If you're a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel the world, like I mentioned. You can see places like Greece, Italy, and China. Also, don't forget their unforgetable landmarks that you will see! Not only do you get to travel the world, but this is a once in a lifetime experience! We won't be around forever! Plus, I bet it will make one heck of a story to tell your grandchildren, am I right?

Finally, we have the service you are providing. Some may say you are better off in the military. This may be so, but would you rather be taking lives, or saving them? Plus, us Seagoing Cowboys were only created because of World War II to clean up the mess. Wouldn't it be counterproductive to start a World War III? Here, you get to help people, improve lives, and do good for your country, and the country you're in. I think that with more of us Seagoing Cowboys, we can make the world a better place.

Us Seagoing Cowboys know how to work hard, experienced a once in a lifetime chance, and supported our and many other countries. We've seen Europe, China, Greece, Italy, and even Panama! We've traveled the world, crossing oceans to and fro, for the good of mankind. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up today!",4
72128,"Imagine a world without garages, gastations, or parkinglots. The problem with today's world is our lives revovle around cars to get us where we want to be and they have become a status symbol for many.  The thought of being without a car scares most people, but limiting car usage is becoming more popular in cities, and has shown many advantages in the enviorment and in the communities.  For example, the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars compltely (Rosenthal).  On the otherhand, Paris, France banded driving due to smog-only odd license plates could drive one day and even numbered plates could drive the next day (Duffer).  Many advantages came with limiting driving in these cities such as, less air poplution from tailpipes, congestion lessened, and indroduced alternative ways of transportaion into differnet communities.

""Passenger cars are 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States"" (Rosenthal).  This means if car usauge was limited than we could cut back on almost 50 percent of our polution in the United States.  ""Transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions"" (Rosenthal).  The limiting of car usage would also help and knock down cars as being the second biggest emissions source in the U.S.  Without so much air polution in the United States we could live healthier and better lives.  We would be able to ruduce global warmimg if we reduce the amount of driving we do.

Another advantage with limiting car usage would be the decrease in congestion around our city and towns.  ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" (Duffer). This means that traffic would die down as well, there would be no more rush hour after work, and the roads would be safer because there would be less people driving on them.

Lastly, limiting car usage would bring people to find alternative and healthier ways to get to where they need to be.  In Bogota, Colombia every year for one day millions of people bike, skateboard, or take public transport to get where they want to be (Selsky).  With people using alternative ways to get to work it would not only  benefit the enviorment as well as benefiting their health.

The answer is clear, we need to limit the usage of cars in America.  Other countries are doing it and now is our time to jump on board with the movement of less car movement.  So the next time you get in the car and buckle your seatbelt think about the advantages that could come from not driving today.         ",4
79938,"I don't like the idea of driveless cars. I feel like if a human can do it we should. Especially when it comes to things like that. like the idea of robots, would you really want something cleaning for you and taking care of older folks and children. I do think they are a good idea for the blind and people not going to far. Like since i live in Indiana, they would be a good idea for people in Indianapolis to get from the mall to like a resturant or something. Nothing major or far like driving from Indiana to California, not a good idea. I just don't trust things like that.

Driveless cars are sort of a good idea. they're are many pros and cons about the whole thing. I feel like they are dangerous because they could malfuncting and blow up or something. Or they will drive right into a buliding at full speed or something. No car is really safe in general, but letting a robot like thing drive your car is kinda a crazy idea. Another con is that they can't really drive by itself, it still needs you to hold the steering wheel and take control when around accident ot people working on roads. I feel like if they want to have driving cars they should just bulid a car that can drive people instead of a car that half does it. Another con is that they are basically illlegal in most states except a couple. Would we have to visit somewhere else to expericence what crazy technology the world has for us now. I also think they are a bad idea because driving are probably going to be directly on their phone, no hand on the steering wheel or anything. And like it says, when the car needs you to take over it will tell you to take over. But i feel like people will just ignore it and get into accidents they could have prevented.

Pros are that you can half drive. You wouldn't have to really pay attention to anything around you and you could just relax while driving. ",3

Also whats possibly on Also whats possibly on Mars, how each planet orbits at different speeds. NASA has sent many people into space to see what its like. Too see if we could have life on Venus and how each planet orbits at different speeds.

Venus is unlikely to live on because it has 97% carbon dioixde blankets. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in acid in Venu's atmosphere.

Even though we would like to put people on Venus its just to likely that someone could die from the atmosphere.

0081f18,"i think that having self driving cars would help alot. there are so many wreacks in the states because some people just dont know how to drive right.

so if we was to invent and sell computerized cars it could stop us from having so many wreaks plus it would also cause us to drive way safer. for instance if your drunk and you have to get home you just sit in the car and it will drive for you since you cant do it yourself because your not in the right stae of mind.

there is also the thought of making better roads but when you think about it that would cost more then a fortune to do. one other reason im all for this invention is because you know that the people making these cars are gonna earn a tone of money so that means more people will be switching to the new car instead of their old one. before you know it there will be somthing new and even better in technology since we just keep getting smarter over the years. who knows we might be driving hover craft later on in a few years because alot can be learned.

although we would also have to make some new laws or change a few of them. like in the text it states that what if somone gets in a wreak in a smart car should the driver be blamed or the companies that sold the the car to that person beheld responcibale. there also still some improvements that have to be made before they can even start selling those cars .

those are the main reasons that i think making smarter cars is a great idea.",3

I highly encourage you to join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Think of how sad you would be if you were devestated by the war and had barely anything left.

Wouldn't you want someone to help bring you supplies such as animals?

Well you can be one of the few people to contibute.

The families over seas are all very kind and appriciative.

Though they are still very much in need.

So, you would just be helping the cause by joining.

Over the past year, me and my friend, Don Reist, have had the opportunity to see historical landmarks.

The chance to just see Europe and China would have been special.

But Don and I got to expirience so much more than that.

We got to see the Acropolis in Greece.

Also, taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, was a treat.

I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Come on.

Don't tell me you wouldn't love to have the opportunity to see the Panama Canal!

All you have to do is join the Seagoing Cowboys.

As you can clearly tell, being a Seagoing Cowboy is truly a great expirience.

We get to help those in need, and also have the chance to see historic landmarks around the world.

I hope that soon, you will decide to be like Don and I and join the UNRRA and become a Seagoing Cowboy.",3
0084f6c,"What exactly is the facial action coding system? Well it enables computers to identify human emotions and expressions. This is an interesting way to understand a indivuals emotional expressions. Children in this mordern day have a tendency of hiding some deep emotions and expressional feelings from their peers,friends,and family. Being able to figure out some of their emotions could save a lot of problems long term.

The worst thing a person can do is hide their emotions from people. This can really lead to a bad depression or other sad emotional syndromes. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it stated that ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, etc."" This shows that a person understanding someone emotions is very diffucult. People can hide their feelings really well especially students when even they are having their worst day.

Facial action coding system can really help adults to understand the true emotions of a student. The story says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insturctor."" This by far is an excellent idea. In the US in today's world a lot of students homework is online. Not even just homework at school but in everyday life it has something to do with technology.

By being said the students that can't comprehend the lesson, there can be an alternative assignment that they can to so at least they are learning something. Doing something that you kind of know and bettering yourself at that is way more benefical then doing something you have no knowledge of. A lot of students don't ask for help when they are struggling with a assignment. Most of the time they either skip it or copy down answer without getting the full structure of the material. If the students are not understanding something in a lesson the material is only going to get way harder for them without any help.

In the end, the facial coding system is a great creation and will be very benefical toward students. Teachers a very educated and have the Knowledge to help the students. If they don't know who is struggling though at all times they can't help every student.                                                   ",4

0098ef4,"Many people in todays society tend to travel by car, but there is advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can stop pollution, and puts people in general in a more active environment. So, there are many other ways of transportation.

In the article, 'Car-Free Cities' it talks a lot about the advantanges of not driving a car. For example, according to the passage ""Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occaional distant motor."" This being said, you can conclude that more people are being more active. Furthermore, the passage says ""Passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" This meaning that some places in the United states gases are half of the areas pollution.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usages, and if other people do it so will the world. For example, according to the passage ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangle square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life."" Moreover, in the passage it also says ""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" Furthermore, ""In this new approach, store are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distance highway."" This meaning the world has a solution to solve the usage of cars. By making suburbs you will be walking distance away from your destination. This also saves so much money, if you were to drive you would have to waste gas. It is also more of a benefit for one who walks, rides their bike, or runs by giving them the benefit of exercise.

By limiting the usage of cars, bike trails, parks, and sports centers have been a big hit. For example, according to the passage, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" Moreover, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicylce paths."" This being said, the need to make such a long bike path means that more people are joining in on the limiting usage of cars, which is a benefit for us humans, and the fresh air that we breathe. People are also becoming more active, for example according to the passage ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;"" Since the parks and sports centers have been blooming people are being more active. New side walks are being replaced so people can actually walk on them, the cut of traffic means less people are driving. In big cities, it just might be faster to get to your destination by riding a bike.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. It helps by lowering the percent of pollution, on top of that it also helps save money. By walking or riding your bike to your destination can benefit you in many ways. It also helps by making the world a better place. People seem to be happier when they see other being active, so the next time one thinks to drive a walking distance, rethink your decision.    ",4

Speaking of emotions, the Facial Action Coding System would be able to prevent students from getting too angry or too stressed. If a student is showing strong negative emotions, the FACS could notify someone or tell the student to take a break.

Many students hide their negative emotions in a classroom, for fear of looking bad amongst their peers. The FACS could help students, by acknowleding their emotions and change the lesson or the atmosphere.

All citizens should participate in this program. In this essay, I will explain why this program should include you in the next trip overseas.

When having deep affection for men and women who have served in wars such as World War Two, you long to give help back to them in repayment. That is why it feels so amazing to sail overseas with vital needs for discouraged people, such as animals or food. I have served for nine trips(the longest contributed by any Seagoing Cowboy), because it gives yourself satisfaction to keep youself busy with activities that lift people's spirits. If you join this program, you can feel like a warrior in different ways.

On these trips overseas, you can also live through rewarding and beautiful sites. With our free time in other countries, we had the opprotunities to see the Acropolis in Greece, and parts of China. We also got to experience what a gondola ride in Italy felt like through streets of water. Visualizing these historic places really make you want to see more of the world, and keep helping our world's health.

People opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place, but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much. Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home, the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments. There are many reasons why you can make up for risks and sacrifices on this trip to pass time or feel more connected to your service.

Becuase of the ways this trip is so benificial to participants, it is a great program to take part in. Seeing beautiful sites and repaying soldiers help you analyze so much more about other places and war. For many people, it concludes as an opprotunity of a lifetime, that will never be forgotten. For these reasons, all citizens should participate in the UNRRA program overseas.",4

If a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse, this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be. If a student loves the class and loves going to school then obviously they will be more ingaged and do better in the class most of the time.

Schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more.

Theoretically thinking, a driverless vehicle could potentially cause a lot less trouble than a vehicle with a human driver. Sometimes, humans don't tend to make the best choices ever.

Many people also die just because some idiot decided they didn't need to pay attention, that text was just too important or than phone call may have been too important. More important than someones life of course. With driverless cars they would not have to worry about any of that, as long as they knew where they were going the car would get them there and back safely.

What's even better than a car you don't have to worry about driving? A car you don't have to worry about driving, while saving gas. According to the text, Mr Sergey Brin forsees cars that would use half the fuel that taxis use in todays world. Even if it wasnt much, if you add up everyone that rides taxis it accumulates and eventually everyones contributing to the problem. So a car that could use only half of the gas we use today, like is there any reason to say no to these cars?

Many people almost never get anywhere on time, some may have too much going on some might just not care. Whatever the case may be, what if these driverless cars could get you wherever you needed to be in the quickest way possible while not breaking the law. The driverless car could get you where you need to get by taking the quickest route possible. With all the advanced technology being promised the car could know whats ahead of it and if it will slow your trip down. For example if the car knows that up ahead is construction zone where you would have to slow down and waste time, it could just take a more efficient way and eventually save you time.

Driverless cars, hopefully soon, will no longer be a thing of the past. With technology just advancing without stopping i think soon driverless cars would just be another normal vehicle you see on the road. To me driverless cars would be an astounding idea. ",4
00b3311,"Did you know that Venus was maybe once like earth? And also maybe know that ""Mechanical Computers"" were used back in World War II that NASA may get ther idea for a invention to study Venus ? Sounds shocking right, well let me tell how and why these two questions may sound odd, but intresting.

NASA has been working on finding ways to study Venus. They have simplified electronicsthat are made of ""silicon carbide"" that have been tested in a chamber that is like Venus's surface, and has lasted for about 3 weeks in the comditons as Venus's surface. They still are working on other inventions that will allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully knowledge of Venus. NASA has also wanted a ship to orbit and hover safely far above the planet so that it can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of photography and videography of Venus. Astronomers have wanted to return to Venus but they wasnt a mission safe and scientifically productive. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because they believe in the solar sytem long ago Venus was like was just like Earth at one point. They also believe that Venus once had the features like eath like an ocean, mountains, valleys, and craters. In Venusian geology and weather present erupting volcanoes and frquent lighting , and maybe even strikes on the land surfaces. Venus atomosphere is about 97 percent of carbon dioxide and has a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Its temaptures are an average over 800 degrees , its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather that we experience on our own planet. Each pervious mission was unmanned and maybe thats a good reason no spacecraft survived the landing, or ecplains why not a single spaceship hs touched down on Venus in more than three decases. And is why Astonomers have also wanted a safe mission to go to Venus. And it is also why its a challenging planet for humans to study,which is like is said before why NASA has been wantiing to find good ways to study Venus. Another project taking us back to old technology us ""Mechanical Computers"". These computures were used in World War II,and these devices were used to make calculations andby using gears and levers and it did not require elctronic at al. Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicate when it came to physical conditons. systens that use nechanical parts can be made mire resistabt to pressure, heat a and other forces.

So Venus is a worthy, despite of the dangers and earth abd beyind should not be limited by daners abd doubts because uou shoild be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginatio and innovation. Meeting the challenge to study Venus has value but not because its interesting but because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimitdating endevaours.                        ",4
00bee4c,"Through out the world a lot of people are excited about the driverless cars that are being developed. However some of them fail to realize the negativities that come with this package. Not having to drive 24/7 would be nice, but at what price? Vehicles are not exactly the most reliable resource.

While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. They will go about thinking that the technology has everything under control. Forgetting that cars that require drivers have difficulties. Yet they will trust a car to drive itself and have no problem? The car you are driving could have miscalculations and make a turn where there is a building!

When in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond. Who is to blame, the vehicle for shorting out or the driver for becoming too un-alert.

Everyone has their own opinions, everyone has their own brain that allowes them to make the wrong or the right decission based on what they believe. Will you allow yourself to fall victim to awe or amazement and wonder at these new inventions. Or will you go over teh pro's and cons of becoming too reliant on the driverless vehicle and less aware of your actions while on the road? ",3
00c3589,"Exploration is key to a humans curiosity.Many people will indeed be anxious to explore something that is said to be impossible or dangerous because of curiosity.""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a prime example. In this article the author states different reasons why it is worth stuying Venus depite the extreme dangers it brings.

One reason why the author of this article supports his ideas well is because he used statistics or in other words he used pathos.In paragraph five, he said""...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""He mentioned the idea of NASA creating a ""blimp-like"" vehicle to fly over the Venusian landscape.Then he went on and entered his counterclaim by saying""...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground condition...,""therefore Venus would only be visible but not accesible and NASA would not be able to take samples of the planet.

Secondly,he states some facts about Venus itself.He added that ""...Venus is the closests planet to Earth in terms of density and size.""This is a good fact to add in to give the idea as to why NASA would choose to attempt studying Venus.Also he siad that""...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""This gives the idea that the study of Venus has already been attempted before and has unfortunately failed every single time.

Last but not least,in his conclusion he built a strong conclusion by mentionding in his opinion that""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginataion and innovation."" This can be used for both life and NASA continuing on trying and trying until they succesfully study Venus.

In conclusion, the author supported his ideas well in the article. He supported his idead with statistics from NASA theirselves and he gave facts about Venus. He also included his counterclaims. Over all he gave a well informend and structures article.   ",4
00cb5dc,"In the passage ""The Challenge if Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that the studying of Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers it presents by explaining the fact that scientist can not of study if that Venus is like Earth because it is studied from a far distance and that they need to get closer and get rock samples. For example the passage states ,"" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientits seeking to conduct a thorough mission to nderstand Venus would need to get close up and pesonal dispite the risks."" This piece of evidence proves that they would have to go through with a mission to Venus to get rock, gas, and other samples for scientists to study to compare Venus to earth. Therfore, in the passage "" The Challenge of

Eploring Venus"" the authors suggestion to study Venus should entirely be accepted with the evidence they provided but also dispite the risks so that we have stand point on how close Venus is to the Earth comparing rocks,gases, and other pieces of evidence.",2
00ccc2d,"Space travel is something we people of Earth have just only begun to tinker with. Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

The planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater..."" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author stated that ""Astromoners are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Shortly after this, they also stated that ""Long ago, Venusm was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The search for life in space has been one outrageously demanded by the public and Venus may very well be the place to look, after we can penetrate the bounderies it has in store. It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.

The author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors."" They also say in the next sentence ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" By surpassing the challenge of Venus, we will have the technology an wisdom to surpass other difficult challenges we may encounter, overall gaining the knowledge and power to gain more knowledge and power.

The exploration of Venus is indeed a difficult and dangerous task, but in the end would be worth while. By advancing our technologies we can bypass the dangers of Venus and pave the road to move onto even more dangerous and difficult tasks, both on out planet and outside our planet. We could gain the knowledge of how similar Earth and Venus are, finalizing if it could have or did support life at one point in time. And the factors making Venus so dangerous, would be minimalized and surpassed. ",4
00d027f,"Imagine a system that can actually help you stay focused and determined with your learning. No more kids dozing off because of boredom, or becoming uninterested with a subject. This advancment in computer software that can recognize human emotions and change the way we learn for the better .

Now take the software mentioned into a class room where it can make ""calculations"" about human emotion just as any other human does. The author, Nick D'Alto, says this ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" he also quotes a Dr. Huang saying ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused or bored."" Take these two quotes and you imagine a super computer that can learn what you take interest in and modify it's self to your liking. This would allow students to take charge in how they learn a concept.

This could be the next big things in learning since computers were first introduced in a classroom. That's not even the limit. This technology could be implimented in home schooled children and online classes as well. The reason being as Dr. Huang puts it ""it could modify the lesson...like and effective human instructor."" This means it would have the power to change lessons if you were not following or just confused. This ability can amplify the process of students learning online or at home.

In coclussion the technology being able to recognize human emotions will only improve the educational system. Being able to tell if a student is bored or confused on a concept will help improve many aspects in schooling. Being able to modify lessons on the spot just like a human insturctor is valuable. ",3
00d4911,"To the senator of florida,

I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposebly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president (according to source 3), there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occured in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.    ",4
00d576b,"Well in my favor I would have the Electoral College reason why is because it keeps all the votes for the presidential election and etc. And each or any electors in your state has his or her own group of electors. And the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their responsibilities are. But the Electoral College it consists or has 538 electors but the majority is to have 270 s that you can vote for the president. By the way once you have voted for the president or senate or governer etc. The system will count how many popular votes or from a vote from Congress and the qualified citizens. But my reason for the electoral college to stay is that once you have voted you can count from the system or it does it for you but if you dont want the electoral college then it will take alot longer for the votes to be process and be accumilated.

Well so there's people or citizen that want the electoral college to keep going but some don't reason to that is in the story this is what it says, ""The electoral college  is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostky assertins withoout much basis in reality"". And its unfair cause it has the winner take all system in each state. And they sometimes have problems getting the votes from some states and they couldn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And the story says from someones opinion ""And the arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" And once a state has voten it  counts as 1 vote.

And some people and the people from the government or like congress,senators,representatives, and more hope that one day while they are voting that the score or number of votes is not a tie. But some citizens arn't into the technology of the electoral vote or how it works. But in that case I would like to not want the electoral collge to keep going mostly due to unfairness, outdated,irrational.

Since the electoral college is still working the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national elction, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible  American popluation did vote in 2012's election.                            ",1
00da297,"I think that the author is right about the idea of studying venus is worthly pursuit despite of the dangers NASA is working on studying venus. Why not study it it use to be like earth. and also it a star you see at night.

Venus is one of the most intresting planets near earth I think it would be intresting to study and so does NASA the text says, ""NASA is working on othe approaches to study Venus for example, some simplified electronics mode of silicon carbide have bee tested in a chamber simualting the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions"". See we could try and study Venus we could be on there for a 2 weeks and leave.

Venus is called the sister planet because of how close it is and like family Venus has the same looks aswhille the text says, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"". See if Venus is like earth we could look at what happened to it and make sure that doesn't happened to us.

Venus is a star we see at night have you ever wonder what it was? Or how it's like earth and has no life that is what NASA and so

many more space programs are trying to find out.

I think that the author is right that we should go study Venus even if it dangerus it's worthy of that risk. it a star and planet in our solar system. Venus is our sister planet and looks like us too, and NASA is finding ways for us to be able to walk on Venus and study it aswhile. ",3
00daaa2,"Pollution is one of the most dangerous causes in the world. However, people need the things that pollutes the air. Such as cars, body sprays,etc. I agree that the citizens should limit car usage.

Fuel is one of the causes that pollutes the air. According to the passage,""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" In addition to that, diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in france. Compared to a 53.3 percent average engines in the rest of western europe. Robert Duffer states that, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of global city."" Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Moreover, the same goes for odd-numbered plates. With that, the smog cleared enough for the ruling french party.

All the countries should try a car-free day. Andrew Selsky said, ""In a program that set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" Some of the advantages of having a car-free day can help make people see that its not about cars or bikes. Even so, Those things are just damaging the air and making it harder to live and breathe. Also stated in the article was that, "" It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by board, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Futhermore, it would help so people can see the world without cars and not pollute the air.

By giving some of the dangerous stuff that we use daily a break. We will see great turn outs and good things happen. Like, less traffic which means less accidents, less fuel used which means less pollution. Lets all help keep our country safe and clean. STOP POLLUTION! I firmly agree that citizens should limit car usage.    ",3
00dd003,"Using the Facial Action Coding System is not necessary whatsoever. This will just be taking up space in already crowded schools, and having schools waste money on a emotion coding system.

These Facial Action Coding Systems will be even more of a distraction. Phones are already enough of a distraction this will be even worse. Kids will just make face expressions to find out what emotion a certain face tells. ""Empathy (feeling somone else's emotional state..."" Most kids like to just have their space and not be bothered. This is also spending money on things that are not mandantory so money will just be wasted. At the end of the day like who is really interested in what a face expression tells about you?

00e047b,"A car is considered by many a nessecity for everyday life; however, limited usage of our cars has many positive advantages. Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our enviroment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.

The smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn't the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the 'Day Without Cars'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)

Vauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is "" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (source 3)

In 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars.

Limiting car usage has positive effects on the enviroment and has shown effective at lowering stress in people. Globally many are already starting to realize adavantages of cutting back on car usage. So while a car may seem like a nessecity, keep the advantages in mind.            ",4

00eabc5,"Just Straight FACS

Anybody can read a room. Whether it's at a party, an important meeting, a funeral, or a Pre-Calculus lesson at 8 a.m., it's easy to look around and see how the people around you are feeling due to body language and facial expression.

Others don't think so, though. Prof. Thomas Huang and his team of experts have come up with new tech that can recognize all 44 muscles in the human face, and create a diagnostic on how a person is feeling. This is interesting, yes, but some may think that this technology could be used in classrooms to get a general feel on what each student is feeling about a lesson.

I believe that using the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in a classroom setting would have no merit and would just be a waste of time and money in public schools across America, because of how weak the technology in the FACS actually is.

In the text, Dr. Huang says that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" and that ""varying degrees of expression"" can still be used to recognize the feelings and emotions of any human being. When applying this to a classroom enviroment, this can't be correct. That is due to many natural factors in humans.

For example, the world has progressed a lot, and more children with mental disabilities and special needs are being allowed to be involved in regular classes. For a student with a form of autism, it may be hard for them to convey certain emotions on a regular basis. The technology wouldn't be able to read their face correctly. Another example is for a student with a physical disability whose face couldn't be read properly by the FACS. There are too many outliers for the technology to be accurate, unless you had a room of children who all express their emotions like an open book.

The text also says that ""most human communications are nonverbal."" I agree with this statement, actually. It proves that one can never tell what a person is thinking just by what they say, or their facial expressions. The only true place you can know how somebody really feels is in their mind. I, for one, never really say or express how I feel about school infront of any sort of teacher or staff. It's a general rule among students at my school to onlt talk about teachers or lessons outside of the classroom. Now, this may not be how it is in other public school settings. If it happened to, though, then the FACS technology would be obsolete in its purpose.

Lastly, in paragraph 9, the text says that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, ""putting on a face"", or a poker face, actually trains your body to be in a better mood. This means that literally anyone could trick the FACS into thinking that they were in a happy mood when need be. Students could easily ""beat the system"" by manipulating the FACS into giving off a false diagnostic every time, and therefore ruining the FACS's credability. Until the FACS can tell when a group of teenagers are faking their emotions, it can't perform its main task.

In conclusion, Dr.Huang's FACS technology cannot work due to how baseless it's ethics are, how difficult it really is to understand emtions just by facial expression, and how easy it is to manipulate it's process.",4
00ef89f,"In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever and here is why.

First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.

In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are.",1
00f3984,"The Face that is on Mars, is just a natural landform. I am here to prove that it is just a natural landform. All of my reasons will come from the passage named ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

I know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in the passage it is stated that when the spacecraft Viking 1 was circling it was snapping photos when it spotted a shawdowy figure like a human face on a region on the planet named Cydonia. After that though, scientisits figured out it was just another Martian mesa common around Cydonia. Next, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor Camera snapped pictures better than the ones that Viking took. Thousands of peole waited for when the image would first appear on a JPL web site. The website revealed that it was just a natural landform after all. Finally, in the very last paragraph it said, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are similar to landforms common around the American West. A scientist named Jim Garvin said ""it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Gavin also stated ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.

So therefore, all of the reasons stated above prove that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It formed a long time ago and that is something to figure out in the future.",2
00f6383,"Lately there has been a lot of contreversy with ways to elect and which way is more effective and what is preferred by the majority of people. The problem with that is that many people are very biased when it comes to elections. Many poeple are raised with a certain way that their parents might have thought them was correct and that was how they were taught to elect. Although there is not a wrong way to elect, there are more effective and quicker ways to do it. I personally think that the best way to vote would be through popularity.

Electoral College is a ""compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."". Many people think that Electoral College is rubbish and complicated and I agree. According to paragraph ten in the passage the first sentence says "" Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" which means that it is more of a process to vote through this system. Instead of you inputing your opinion on who you would like to be President you are basically saying that you believe that this slate of electors have a better idea of who would be a better President.

The electoral college is known to be extremely unfair to voters. In paragraph thirteen the second sentence states ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" which is true because the slate of electors are obviously teams of people who root for the same candidate which gives independent voters close to no chance if they are not voting for the same candidate.

Overall I think that the electoral college way of voting is old and worn out and maybe its time that it went out of business and the popular vote takes its place. With the popularity vote not only do you get to have a chance of choosing the president without the electoral vote canceling out your vote but you also get to go around saying that you're part of the reason why your candidate won. Many people may disagree with me and say that my opinion is not a good opinion but from all of the statements that I have heard, I will still continue to believe that the popularity vote is the best way to vote.

00f6ac7,"With conditions far harsher than on Earth and anything humans have expirenced, one the closes planet to Earth, Venus is increadibly inhosbitable. Dispite those facts scientists are still fascinated by the planet do to it's increadible similarity to Earth, but the conditions have prevented scientists from investigating throughly. With all spacecraft sent to Venus being destroyed it is a suprise that we are still trying to study this planet, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" gives very little insight into why scientists are still attempting to study the planet.

To start off Venus is our sister planet with very similar density and size to Earth with similar features with mountains, valleys, and other rocky structures. The author states that many scientists think that Venus could have supported life long ago and may have been covered in ocean and if this is true we may get much insight as to why Venus would change to become an exteremly inhospitable planet. Though the author gives us very little as to what we will be able to do with this information or what other information we may get. The author also mentions space travel but states only that, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crusial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" 4). Other than that small mention the author does not go into depth on this idea.

Though the thought of being able to explore and study one of the closes planets to us is great the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" does not do to good of a job of informing us as to why we would attempt to weather such harsh conditions. With the temperature going over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure that could liquify metal its hard to reason why we should attempt to send probes to Venus let alone travaling there personaly and the author does not do a very good job covincing us that this is a good idea. They give us very little information as to what they will get from this and give us information that makes this sound crazy to attempt. ",3
00fca9b,"The authors sugestion that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and how he supported his claim shows his enthusiasm in the topic of exploring venus.This is supported in how he says its a worthy pursuit, how human curitostity will lead to equally dangerous endeavors, and the fascination astronomers have with venus.

When the author's how human curiosity lead to dangerous endeavors is shown in paragraph 3 stating that the atmosphere is covered in highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds.

Another example is how exploration in venus is a worthy pursuit is in paragraph 2 stating ""... contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us."" shows the challenge in studying venus.

Lastly the astronimers fascination with venus is stemed from the fact venus has features simalor to earth.The author states that ""The planet has a suface of rocky sediment...features such as valleys, mountains, and crators."" show the simalaritis are still there.

In conclusion his idea has a multitued of support in his artical.",3
00fd564,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is valuable because it can help students learn the material the instructor is teaching that day much faster allowing the students to have a fun yet educational experience in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System will make the classroom more entertaining to all grade levels even in college, and the system will identify the emotions the user is feeling and will adjust the lesson plan to the students' liking.

The emotions are one of the only ways we can tell what each other are feeling but also thinking at the moment.

These days the only way that communicate mainly is through texting and most people don't like to call each other because people are becoming too caught up in technology to actually talk to the person they are trying to communicate with.

Also the people are becoming too lazy to actually call the person or actually go to the person in person and have their conversation with them.

In the education department of the government they are coming up with all these standardized test to prove that the student is eligiable to go to the next level of education, but in most of the schools in the United States who use these standardized tests most of the students fail the test and have to retake the test again the next year or semester.

With Professor Huang's creation of this tecnology the education system will be getting better and better tests results if this system is implemented into the schools all around the United States.

The Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because every child deserves a good education even if they are poor or don't have money to pay for the schooling.

The reason the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because the software will help students all grade levels succeed in the real world and have a good education and will help the student find good jobs once they graduate high school or college.

The Facial Action Coding System could actually help therapy patients and patients with PTSD and help the therapists, doctors, and counselors figure out what the patients are thinking or feeling at the moment.",3

Nasa wants to send humans to study venus it will be dangerous to go to venus but its worth the try to see if its good like weather and to see if there oxygen. venus is like Earth twin they are really close to each other but venus density and size are occasionally bigger.

Venus has over ninety seven percent of carbon dioxide. Whats more challening is that there are more clouds than earth. the temperatures can also be very dangerous up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 greater then normal earth averrage.

Michael Malin even took a better picture twenty two years later that showed it wasn't a face, but some people weren't satisfied. Three years later they took an even better one, showing that it wasn't a face at all.

This is not a face becasue the author says in paragraph two, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows"" Some people didn't agree because ""it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of the year"" and to disprove this they took a better picture in the summer.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the debate of the exploration of Venus is exposed for discussion. The article brings up many contriversal topics discussing whether or not Venus is worth exploring. Though most of the article talks about the dangers and overall negativities Venus has to offer when it comes of exploring it, the author takes this information and turns it into postives. The author demonstrates that although Venus is dangerous and almost impossible to explore, attempting to do just that willl be well worth it in the long run. Due to this, the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

In the article, the author first brings up the fact that Venus has a very toxic and dangerous atmosphere. They go on to say that because of this, the conditions in Venus are far to extreme for any human to survive in. Then, the author even posses the question of: Why are scientists trying to explore Venus more if it's so inhospitable? The author uses this question to transition into how they support the exploration of Venus, by saying how despite the inhospitable environment, Venus has many Earth-like qualities which intrigues many astronomers. In the article the author states, ""... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This shows that learning more about Venus could potentially be a great advantage to Earth since it's the most similar planet to Earth in the entire solar system.

A second problem the author states about exploring Venus is that every attempt to explore the planet has failed. One reason being is how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft to survive for more than a couple of hours on Venus's surface. In the article the author states, ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" The author contradicts this later in the article by explaining the technological advacements that NASA has accomplished to help prevent having another failed mission to Venus. The author states, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This demonstrates how even though Venus is about impossible to explore, technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet's surface.

Throughout the article, the author demonstrates that the postives of exploring Venus outweigh the negatives by giving strong evidence as to why the positives eliminate the problems when it comes to exploring Venus's surface. Although there are many major issues with exploring Venus, the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems. Not only does the author do this, but they show how Earth can discover and learn many valuable things about Venus that can help in the long run. So through very strong evidence about the positve that was able to outweigh the negative, the author was able to support the idea of studying Venus very well.  ",4

""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" But the Face is just a natural landform discovered on Mars by NASA.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the face. It was discovered that there was no alien monument. On paragraph seven, the text states, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos....There was no alien monument after all."" This proves that they found out the Face was not an alien monument.

But many people were still not satisfied so, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to Mars for a second look.

On paragraph twelve, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.""

01290ec,"Luke Bomberger is a who had started working in a grocery story and a bank, just when he got out of high school. Once he went on this trip to Europe with his friend Don Reist. Luke started enjoying going to oversea trips, even though he knew it would take a long time. Have you ever wanted to take an oversea trip? If your answer is yes we would like you to come and sign up for The United Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration. Its for SEagoing Cowboys that are willing to take care of horses, youngcows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

When you go through the proccess of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Bomberger was a confident man to go on his journey with his best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel more a live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything! Taking care of animals is another thing to, if you absolutely love animals than of course you might want to join. Especially if you are a farmer boy.

Going on the journey made Luke feel alive, and it should make you feel alive if you think you are going to join the club that takes you overseas. I know all the men loved to go on that trip to take care of many farm animals, especially if you do that your everyday life. When Luke was on that trip he loved it, he first(1st) went to New Orleans for the trip. They got there the day the Pacific war ended , on August 14th. On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and he was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on so he stayed on going with it and he was confident in his choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger! Keep in mind that you can see animals , help people, and you can also visit places you have never visited in your whole life.",3
012c9be,"Have you ever thought there was a possiblity of going to venus? Yeah i didnt either but i completly agree with the autors point of view on this article i agree about going to venus for more information cause it would help us understand what happened to venus and if one point and time it was like earth.

The challenge of going to venus with anything is its massive air pressure, solfuric acid rain, and really hot surface temptures and we currently dont have anything to actually be able to survive those condtions for more then maybe three weeks or less so what i say we do is that we look at metals that are restiant to stuff like that and see if we could try combining the atoms to make an alloy.

In conclusion in my personal opionion i think yes we should try a little harder to get to know more about venus cause it would explain a kot and tell us if one day it was like earth and what happened to it so we could avoid it so that doesnt happen to earth and on top of that the more we learn about it the more the possiblity of it maybe becoming a hospital planet to go to if we need to ever move off of earth.

But despite the belife that life was there, it's also that NASA and others are just curios of what they could find from Venus.

First, the author did a good job pointing out and bringing in the reader with Venus ""once have been most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago"" but he also goes and continues on how it was covered with ""oceans""

Secondly, the author tell's us that there are ""familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"" On Venus. This makes us want to pursuit the study on Venus despite the dangers it presents. Even with all the critical coditions Venus has, this example want's us to go and visit Venus.

Lastly, "" Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity."" Human curiosity makes us want to go to Venus and see what we can find and look. Most humans are very curios and when they find out there was once life in Venus, it makes us want to go and see what's out there. The author put this in to give us another reason why we should go out to Venus. He puts in ""human cruiosity"" to bring us in.

Finaly, from all of the eight paragraps I feel as if the author could have done a better job on their part to explain why it's ""worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" Also that the comparison between Earth and Venus was fine. But going to Venus and exploring and pointed out that there was once life in Venus gives a good example of going and exploring Venus.",3
013ac83,"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governements, and are  acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advavtages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Cars are defined as a motor vecheil that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas.  acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pullotion into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pullotion.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hostiptal because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pullotion. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pullotion said carlos arturo plaza.

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often.  it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in his/her house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.

in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.    ",4

Also that by seeing pictures of hwo aliens look there similar too us in a way , but the mouth is weird shping like it's not a human mouth that people think it may be . Makes you have second thoughts and makes you want to investigate more on the "" The Face On Mars "" . Each year we have something new on this face of mars.

So we investigate more on these pictures to see exactly what were trying to find out because it doesn't add up how would I big hu,man face be on mars. doesn't make since too me. Yeah and like "" Garvin "" says we don't pass over a human face very often so something isn't right here. The scientist put there all into this to figure out what there dealing with.

So finally in 2001 we've came to an conclusion and find out from all our investigations that it's really just a ' mesa ' It's an Middle Butte in the Snakwe River Plain of Idaho It's the same height of as "" Face on Mars "".",1
014f1b3,"Dear state senator,

I think that changing to election by popular vote is the best thing to do. We vote and see which ones most popular and that's who gets to be president. Because more people think he'll be a better president. Another reason is that's what people want. Lastly we wont make the wrong choice. We vote and see who's the best but also theres an election process. We think it would be better with no election process at all. I was imformed that we dont really vote for president, we vote for a slate of 34 democratic pledged to that person. so basicaly were not really voting so and so for president. So it seems like the govenment is fooling us. i just think we the people should vote for president not a slate but the president. and whom ever has the most popular votes wins. The government thinks they know whats best but what happens when people dont go threw with what they say,, we know whats best.                    ",2
0151c0f,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It just doesn't make much sence.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",4
0155be4,"Everyone would like to have car that drives them around. But whouldn't people get annoyed with not being in control. Having driverless cars are cool in some way but also can be dangours. There are positive and negative to have the driverless cars. They shouldn't develop driverless cars because drives still have to be alert, nobody wants to wait their turn to drive, and taffic laws say only a safe car is when a human has full control of it at all times.

The drivers that are in the car still have to be alert. The driverless car alerts the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways. Also when they are dealing with traffic. Like roadwork, or accidents the driver has to take the wheel at those times.

Nobody wants to wait for their turn to drive. Driveless cars only let the drivers drive when they are in traffic or pulling out somewhere. Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive. Most people wont like the car being in control and not them.

Some laws are written with the assumption that the only safe about a car if a human has control of it at all times. Most states it's illegal to even test computer driven cars. There are some countrys that limited use of semi-autonmous cars but the manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as they know the cars are safe.

Driverless cars are good for someone people but most people would like to be in control when they drive. They shouldn't develop the cars if only some of the people like the cars and will use them.

0156ea6,"Venus is one of the planets that have the same density and size and used to have mountains,valleys,craters and it also used to have oceans which means it used to have life but the pressure will kill us because the pressure is 90 times stronger than ours.

It is hard to go to venus because sometimes we are farther and sometimes we are closer to venus. All of our space missions to venus have been unmaned because no spacescrafts hasnt survivded the landing longer than a few hours. on the planets surface the atmodspheric pressure is 90 time than on our own planet. venus used to be covered with oceans and had valleys. mountains and craters. NASA want to send people to study venus. a vehicle would be needed to hover across venus surface. systems made by mechanical devices will by crushed by the pressure.

So the exploration of venus will be difficult but we will soon need a planet because once we run out of material we wont be able to go anywhere.",1
015ac93,"Should venus be explored? There are many different aspects, and opinions on the subject, but the author gives us very good reasons why it should be explored and studied. One of the reasons is that belive it or not venuse is the most simalar planet to earth, also the scientist at NASA said they are working on a blimp like vehicle that could go up to 30 miles high. That means if they made this structer they could avoid all of the harsh conditions on ground level at venus such as the armospheric pressure, and the unbarable heat that is a crazy total of 800 degrees. If they would make this vehicle the pressure would drop substantionaly and so would the heat from 800 degrees to around 170 degrees, the solar power and radation would also be very plentiful and wouldn't exceed Earth levels. The conditions would definetly no be easy to deal with, but they would at least be survivable. There is one problem thought people at NASA can not document their finding because of conditions which would make it where cameras could not be used. This is because the most the light cannot penetrate the dense atmospher. But there maybe a solution, the thing is we might just have to go back in time. For example scientists are looking back on older technology, this technology would be mechanical computers, this is good because these computers do not requier any technology, they use gears and levers and would be substainable on venus. That is how the author suggests that the study of venus should be pursued. As it said in the artical dont look at it such as dangers just bigger challenges.",3
016010c,"Driverless Cars

Driverless cars are coming in the future. In the future, no one will probably need to buy cars because they won't need them. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, that will happen. He sees a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. There are many great things about driveless cars, but there are some bad things as well.

Driverless cars are really beneficial. Driverless cars have way more senors and alerts than regular cars. For example, if the car is about to back up into an object, the driver's seats will vibrate to let you know. Also, within the past 10 years, sensors on the driverless cars have become way more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Driverless cars are also very safe to use. The cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mile per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Even though the word ""driverless"" may scare you, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Which means you are still somewhat in control of the car. The cars may be able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the time comes. The car can quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Basically, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. (Paragraph 7)

Driverless cars are going to become the next big thing. They won't just become beneficial to you, but everyone else as well. The cars would only use half the fuel that today's taxi use. Which is a huge deal because we as a whole, we use a lot of fuel. Also, it will offer more flexibility than a bus. Just imagine that. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes these such cars would fundamentally change the world, and everyone else should believe that too. (Paragraph 1)

Some people may agrue that letting a car be in control is just absurb. You never know what the car might do. It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are very safe and have major benefits. Some people may be scared of letting a car be in a control, instead of them being in control of the car. But no one should have nothing to worry about. As long as you stay alert, you should be fine. Even though the car can do many things by itself, it still sends you heads up when it needs your assistance. Driverless cars coming very soon in the near future. Try them and see how they are.",5
163804,"Cars have been a necessity to us for as long as I can remember. Billions of people around the world use cars everyday. Without cars in our lives many people would be lost and not know what to do. Thinking of a world without cars is unreasonable to the people of today, but if they thought of all the good not driving everyday does for the world then it would probably be a different story.

Many places are enforcing people to go without there cars transporting them everyday, which could be a good thing. Heidrun Walter a man in source 1 states, ""Seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here."" By saying this he is showing how many people like living their lives without all the troubles cars can cause. People of this community dont have to worry about being ran over by cars or being stuck in traffic everyday. David Goldberg, another man in source 1 also states, ""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" In saying this he portraying that we need to focus on more important things and stop worrying about cars, which hurt us more in the long run than they do helping us.

Vauban isn't the only place that has enforced the rule of not using cars. Many other places have done so also. Robert Duffer states, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" By saying this the author is explaining how the use of cars have dramatically polluted a city. Just think, if there were no cars, then there would be less pollution to worry about hurting all the city's. It is not hard to ride a bike to the places you need or want to go. Instead of using cars everyday and hurting our enviroment, people should think of how much good they would be doing and money they would be saving by taking another type of transportation than just cars.

Bogota, Colombia has also taken the no car use into affect. They have used many other types of transportion such as hiking, biking, and even skating to there destination. Businessman Carlos Arturo from source 3 says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" He and many other citizens of this place agree with saving our enviroment and not using cars. Not using cars is less stressful because your not consistently worring about gas, the car breaking, or getting into an accident with another driver.

Just imagine your life without using a car everday. Not using a car isn't that bad and doesnt hurt you or the people around you as much as it does having one. Using a car everyday puts your life at risk, takes your money, and hurts the enviroment. Life without cars would be simpler and less stressful in our world today.                                    ",4

One way that the new new facial action coding system would be good to read emotions of students because it could help figure out people's emotions. One deatil to support my claim is that in the story it says "" for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face , of course most of us would have troube actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy or sad. That means that with the facial scan computer they acn do it with no hassle at all.

One reason to support is that in the text it says ""Dr Huang oberves thata artist such as da vinci studied how human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.

Venus is worth exploring because it was probably covered in oceans a long time ago. in the article the author said, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". this implies that, since there probably used to be water on Venus, there is a chance that Venus could have supported life at one point. because where there is water, there must be life.

01711c3,"Driveless cars can be a very great enhancement in the future's society. Driveless cars can save fuel, they have very high experience, and they contain many gadgets to hold itself together for a very long time.

Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" (Paragraph 2) Their has been very little accidents with driveless cars than there has been with humans driving cars.

Third reason why driveless cars are positive to the society is that the Google cars has many reasonable parts and technology to ""hold itself together."" ""Google modified Toyota Prius using position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor.

(Paragraph 4) The technology of all the input is great enough to acheive the skill of a human at the wheel.

Driveless cars can be very helpful to society. However, traffic laws writes that with a assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Feedback from the Google cars driving before 2009 spectulates that,""So far, they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveway or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" (Paragraph 2) Driveless cars don't have complete control over the car at all times, so drivers must still be focused at all times.

1.87E+098,"Do you think you would be able to live without your car? It would be less difficult than you think! In fact, there is a whole town named Vauban, Germany, that has given up their cars! According to Source 1, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, unless of course you have the money to buy a parking garage space for a whopping $40,000. A citizen of the car-less town, Heidrum Walter admits, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas of the US, according to Source 1. If only we had more towns like Vauban, maybe our impact on the world would be less destructive.

Some towns ban cars for a few days at a time. Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution. Congestion in Paris went down 60 percent and the smog from the pollution cleared up enough that they rescind the ban. Some people would complain that having little to no cars will be an issue for jobs, delivery companies, or getting children to and from places. There's always a bus, and there's always the option of car pooling! Bogota, Columbia is another town that has done a car free day, except Bogota's is annual. These Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to places during the car-free day, according to Source 3. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of this annual car-free day, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in Bogota. I think more towns should ban cars for just a few days. We could all get a little excersize, help the environment, and improve our mood and lower stress!

A recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, Source 4 says. The number of miles driven in the US was at it's height in 2005 and dropped steadily after. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was almost 9 percent below that peak! Some sociologists believe that if this pattern continues, it will have lots of beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, according to Source 4. Some places, such as New York, have car-sharing programs and bike-sharing programs, which is a nice way to get from place to place that's healthy for you and your environment.

There's so many reasons why we should use our cars less! Like I explained, it's very healthy for your environment, and if you choose to walk or bike, its healthy for your body, too. Also, pollution rates would go down quite a lot if we would just carpool or walk/bike to places! People have said that they feel so much happier and stress free from not using a car all the time. So why not take the time to help your environment and call somebody up to carpool, get that bike fixed, or hop on that bus!                                    ",4
018985d,"Identifying Human Emotions

Imagine being able to figure out exactly how anyone in this world are feeling with just a computer. Now software has developed that could help you do just that. The Fcial Action Coding System has applications that will be extraordinary to modern day technology.

Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman created the the FACS. All which have six emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are emotions that are used on a daily basis around the world so they are pretty basic. Video imagery is used that tracks one's facial movements. Therefore it can identify mixed emotions. The video imagery compares each expression with a neutral face in order to figure your emotions.

Imagine being at school on your classroom computer learning something boring, and all of a sudden the topic becomes fun. Dr. Huang predicts that your classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. It would be useful to many students in order to make and help them learn better. This same technology could make identifying emotions much easier. The boring lesson for you would modify. This way the computer will know to keep giving you boring lessons or fun ones.

Facial muscles are obviously an important item in this. If the technology could not identify the way your facial muscles move, then the technology would not work. Not only do your muscles express emotion, but they also help produce them. The article states that a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. This clearly would help the actors express themselves better, thanks to our face muscles. People may not notice, but we imitate other people's facial expressions with empathy.

Who would have thought that sience and technology could be involved with a big feature of who we are. Sometimes being able to figure how someone is feeling. At times we may even have to bug them in order to figure the emotion. Now with the new technology of FACS, this task will be easier. Even for students in a classroom, this will be valuable.               ",3

To begin, I strongly disagree with driveless cars, because people love to be in control. For an example, a marriage relationship the husbad and the wife both think their in control or want to be.. Do you actully think that people will let go of their saftey for a car that drives on its own? Can the American citizen trust a car that on its own?

Also if the car can drive on its own what the point of a person getting their lisense. Or what about an whole sport create from driving Nascar. This would be an perfect upset for a roit. You have owners of the driving sports losing money for an driveless car that is not really safe. For an example, think about tapes and cds how they drop in production. Since poeple have ipods mp3s,itunes, and phones their no need to keep making production for music. So to bring back the driveless car could evn make the economy at drop.

To carry forward, is the nation ready for the change, theirs a prieod of time with everything. Are we sure that us humans are not jumping into things to fast.

For an example, the Model -T the nation rode on horses very long time before Ford became the new era. even with the horse they did revole many they had the invention on the light bug with the horse carriage.

018ff85,"Driverless cars are the future! ""Google has had cars that could drive idependently since 2009. Thier cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far , Google cars aern't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when dealing with complicated traffic issues.'' Driverless cars have been around for a while now; even though they are not fully developed they are becoming more and more relavent and it's time to imbrace that. Imbrace that they may even help prevent any sort of crash in the future. While also getting people to thier destinations fast and saftely.

There are still problems to face even in the light of things. For example.

""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivier, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states t is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" There are still many strides to take in acheving driverless cars on rode but as soon has those obsticles are tackled everyone will be much happier. With saftey has the main concern the laws that will be made for these driverless cars will insure that the utmost care and concern for health take precident. As soon

has the laws have been made the states wil also be more open the idea of a drverless car on thier streets.

Has stated earlier there are still a few problems with the idea of driverless cars but they are really close to frution. Possibly even on the cusp on perfection. ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the rode ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

All of that simply means driverless cars are not 100 percent driverless but they very very close. If they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves thats half the battle and the rest will follow in suite with time.

""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotatng sensor on the roof, a video camera mountedd near the rearview mirrior, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciver, and an inertial motion sensor. The most impportant bit of technology in this system is the spinn sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constanctly uppdating 3-D model of the car's surrondings."" The technology is there for the drverless cars to start becoming a real prossiblity in the near future. They may even fully take over and allow for a much more easy going experinces while driving. And also allow for beyond human level control of the ride.

"" Telsa has prjected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on the autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plam to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The rode to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us. but we grow closer to the destination everyday."" Fully driverless cars really are in the near future. There are small little pushes that still must be made but right around the corner of those is a paradise of safe relaxing transportation for all to use. With driverless cars the future will be a bright one. And saftey while driving will no longer be a concern. ",4

Bascaily saying that the vehicle would have hard time to stay on the ground. The temperature would be as The text states in paragraph 5 ""around 170 degrees fahrenheit"".

019e2c4,"Have you ever thought about what the world would be without cars? You're probably telling yourself how would I get from my house to the stores. Maybe you should try walking because cars tend to cause damage to our environment. We the people should try limiting driving because if we do we won't have pollution,we wouldn't have to deal with smog,and even better protect our environment. Greenhouse gas has reduced since automobiles were limited in the suburbs.

Limiting cars could have a great impact on reducing air pollution. Countries such as China are known as one of the most polluted countries due to th amount of gas it uses. A businessman Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""this identifies that people actually care about pollution. Pollution can also be bad for us humans because not only does it affect our breathing but it can also led to death due to the types of chemicals that we take in. Paris is a city who has dealt with smog and took care of the situation really quickly.

Smog is a major factor why people all around the world are either limiting driving or even banning cars with in the region. An example of that would be Paris who had were near a record day setting of pure smog. The effect of this led Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear air of the global city. Motorist were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer the consequences by getting fined 22-euros. This difference led to a congestion which went down to about 60 percent in the capital of France. Animals have suffered the most since cars started to evolve or became more useful.

The environment in which we live in has suffered consequences as well. Organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency are stepping in to help out within the community. They started to propmote car reducing due to the 80 percent of approprations by law have gone to highways and the rest towards other transportations.

Now you see why we should start walking instead of driving because its good for our health but the main reason is that it limits driving. It also reuces pollution as well as smog, and keeps the environment clean. Are you willing to sacrifice your driving addiction for the sake of human kind and our animals.            ",3
019e8c3,"Driverless cars could be the car of the future.

Many companies like GM and Google are working to create the driverless car.

They are working on improving the models that were already created, but these new care could lead to bad events.

Because of the lack of human attention, computer errors, and new liability questions driverless cars should not be developed.

Sitting in the driver's seat of a driverless car, may cause more issues than benefits.

According to the article, ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

In order to drive. the human can not be distracted by phones or food, but with the idea of being in a driverless car, the human will be.

In self-driver cars, people are distracted by their phones, even though they must pay attention to road.

The distracions will be more dangerous in driverless cars because as the article states, ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. When people enter the new cars, they will believe that they do not have to pay attention because the car is driverless.

When the car malfunctions, the person is the car would be so distracted that even with devices to get the driver's attention, he or she would not be able to react quickly enough.

The extreme lack of attention would cause accidents, injuries, and deaths.

Driverless cars are run by sensors, hardware, and software.

In many cases, these items are known to crash or suddenly stop working.

A computer crashing can lead to bad events and having that computer crash while driving a car would make the events twice as worse.

The brakes may stop working, the car might steer itself off the road, or it could even steer into another car.

If humans have no control over the car, they can not try to steer the car the other way when it crashes.

People would believe they are invincible with the new cars, but techhnology is know to fail.

When technology fails, the driverless car would get into some crash.

With the crash, liabiltiy questions would erupt.

The article states that ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""

The person in the driver seat would want to blame the car and the company that created it.

The car company would want to blame the person for lack of attention.

According the the article, ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident.""

This creates more trouble for state governments.

Driverless cars seem great innovative with the idea of not having to ever drive again.

Although there is real danger that accompanies driverless cars.

With the thought of the car being invincible, humans will be less alert.

When the system goes down, people would not be able to react in time.

The people who do not react in time would cause accidents and blame the car companies.

Driverless cars would be more trouble than helpful. ",3
01a0d33,"In this article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,""

the author states negative and positive things about driverless cars. There are many reasons these cars can be positive or negative. The driverless cars would have a more positive effect on the driving world. There are multiple reasons the driverless cars are a good thing for everybody.

The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This evidence from the article shows that these driverless cars are safe. There are multiple crashes a day with regualr human driven cars. With these driverless cars humans would be much safer. The text also states, ""Google cares aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver..."" This shows that the car is not fully driverless, but this may help to keep the driver alert. This helps whoever is driving stay more alert while on the road.

According to the text, ""For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."" This illustrates how the company will add many sensors to the driverless car. They want to make the car as smart as possible. This text shows that they are trying to copy the skill of a human driving a car.

One example from the text is ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."" This proves that the driverless cars can do many things. It goes to show how many good qualities the driverless car has. There are many more things about this car that are very helpful when it comes to driving.

Many people may say that driverless cars are a negative thing. All of this evidence from the text clearly states that they are very positive. They may say they are too expensive or that they are not completley driverless. The company is not done constructing these smart cars. They are hoping to become fully driverless. There are very few negative aspects about the driverless car.

There are many positive things about the driverless car. The development of these cars is going to have a positive effect on many people around the world. These cars will help

keep people safe. The world is constantley changing with new technology. This car is just another positive change in the world.           ",3
01a39ed,"Since the beginning of time people have always wanted the next big thing. After watching many movies where cars that don't need drivers are being used, people have wanted to make this a reality. Since 2009 there have been cars that could drive independently under certain conditions (paragraph 2). However, by making these driverless cars legal it makes driving even more dangerous.

In paragraph 7 it states ,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" After drivers get use to this car they will be more relaxed and not as alert as usual. It will be easy for drivers to drift off or get distracted. This is because the car is doing most of the work. This could cause many wrecks that could injure not only the driver, but others on the road too.

When driving a driverless car many drivers would not be aware of their surroundings. In paragraph 8 it says , "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the in-car system is actually a saftey feature."" If drivers are texting while using a Driverless car , then it means they are not paying attention. In an emergency the driver would not have enough time to stop. If a child or animal ran out infront of the car, it would be to late. The driver would not have enough time to react and stop the car. The car would not have enough time to alert the driver.

Another con about a driverless car is who to blame when an accident occurs. Paragraph 9 states ,"" If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" Many car accidents take place each day, which means the odds of a driverless car getting in an accident are probably pretty likely. If this did occur the driver could blame the manufacture saying that the car didn't alert the driver. The manufactures could blame the driver by saying that any driver of a driverless car must always be alert. This now affects not only the driver, but the manufactures and the other people in the accident.

Driverless cars would make roads even more dangerous and unsafe. They give drivers an excuse to not pay attention to the road and the things around them. This could cause very serious accidents. It is safest if cars remain where drivers are always in control. ",4
01a53e1,"In the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggustion that Venus is worth studying has many thoughts in our heads. Is it really worth it? Should we consider it or focus on our planet? Well, the author has many reasons to why we should continue researching it.

A supported reason to the author belief is that it could be a back up plan for us if something were to happen to earth. in the text it says,"" Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance too"" ( paragraph 2). Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. IT would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing.

Another reason is it could help us with futuristic things. Better things than what he whave right now. In the article it stated,"" Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. It would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing"" ( paragraph 5). We can find and build different tools to help us reach Venus and to study more about what could be our future planet.

While i see the authors mindset on this article, there are many con's to the ""twin"" planet. Its not very survivable land for us to stay and live in. In the text it says,""

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface. ( paragraph 3). This can cause alot of damage and lots of fear within people if we were to ever live here

01ad79e,"Honestly, i feel very in the middle of this subject.It indeed would be nice for teachers to know when and what a stdents emotions are but,at the same time that could also be a pesonal thing. school computers should detect sadness,boredum, and or anger.On the other hand, it could be a good thing.What if the kid is very sad all day everyday?The device could send at message to the teacher so that they can talk.this could prevent a suicide and more things in that nature.

The reaon I think this is because like I said before thats not the schools buisness if im sad or happy.I wouldnt mind anyone knowing my emotions,but everyone isint me, people have different opinions and very many peopke wouldnt like that.

So I think id give my honest opinion and go with i dont know evryone isin't the same and were all human and have different opinions,characteristics ect..If it were to be in school computers i'd say you should give out a form for the sudent and or psrent to sign.Nothing like that should just be added.If this is added to school computers it Should be strongly suggested if not approved by parents.

01ae85f,"Dear State Senator, I am feeling the need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes for the president of the united states. I feel this way for three reasons. The first reason is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The last reason is because the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters.

The first reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes,is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the Electoral College still has it's defenders. That was the first reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The second reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes, is because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, butr for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So the Electoral College usually wins since the votes go in to the House of Representatives first, which is really unfair to the other people that are doing the election. That was the second reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The last reason why I think that they need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes, is because at the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair nto voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. But it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arrguments in favor of it are mostly asserstions without much basis in reality. That was the last reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

State senator i'm writing you this letter so you can hopefully change the Electoral College to election by popular votes. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. so the only last words that I have to say to you are: Abolish the Electoral College!    ",3
01b55c8,"Fellow Citizens, there are many reasons why limiting car usgage has outstanding oppritunities and advantages.

For an example, If there aren't people out there spending their hard earned money that they worked for, for an expensive car that they are just going to use to get to someplace faster when they could just stop being lazy for once and walk or run, ride bikes, hike, or take a bus, instead of spending money after money to fill a car up to just waste gas, and to fill it up again. Running, riding bikes, hiking, etc. gives you a chance to experience reality. Being outside gives people a chance to see the earths real beauty, and to smell the fresh air. Limiting car usage helps people stay in shape and keeps them healthy if their not just sitting in a car for half a hour when they could be running or walking.

Residents in Vauban, Germany are permitted car ownership, but there are only two places to park : large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. About 70 percent of Vauban's families do not iwn cars, an about 57 percent sold a car to move there. Having a car makes peoples tense, and being in a place where there isnt alot of car usgae makes people much happier. People who live in places where cars arent used as oftn as other states, those towns place stores in walking distance, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

An amazing advantage that people can can from limiting the usage of cars is less drunk drivers, or even none. If there's less drunk drivers, there's less car crashes and less deaths. Everyone understands that you have to be 21 or older in most states to drink alcoholic beverages. The big adavntage out of this is, if older people were to get drunk, they would be forced to call a cab, or even walk home. Their not putting noone else's life in danger, and this would lower the crashes and death fatalities per year.

As as many cars that there is in the world, all the use of them would probably pollute the world. Paris enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of the near-record pollution.

Limiting car usage gives you the oppritunity to be with your family and friends and spend more time with them then you normally would having a car. You can walk and talk with them on the way to work, you can stop by the park and have some fun on your way to the grocery store. The best part about this is, you dont have to worry about the roads being busy. You ca walk, run, hike, and bike without having to hear the noisy streets, the honking, the screeching, etc.

What's the point in having a car that your just going to be wasting money on, when running, walking or riding a bike is free and even cheaper and safer than driving a car. What are you gonna do when your car breaks down? Are you gonna keep spending your money on when it keeps breaking? Why do that when you have two perfectly good and healthy legs and you can run or walk somewhere?

Just take a moment to think about the fines every single person breathing in the world has received? Alot of money wasted on something idiotic huh? just imagine if every state, continents, islands, and places we dont know about all stopped using cars, or even just limited the car usage. We'd be saving a whole ton of money, we'd basically all be middle classes.

This whole situation is a win-win, You get to be with your family 24/7, Running, walking, biking, hiking etc. is all an amazing way to keep people healthy. People dont have to worry about drunk drivers, or car crashes, or car fatalities. People can finally stop spending their hard earned money that they're just going keep spending and wasting on gasoline or to fix your car when its having problems and it breaks. Families can save the money that they would normally be spending on gasoline and start saving for a trip to take their family on to spend more time with them, or to take a trip for yourself.

There are plently more reasons and outstanding advantages that limiting car usage gives you, but these are some of the very best! Just remember, The only good advantages a car can give you is getting you somewhere faster, and keeping you comfortable and safe. But they are also the most danagerous, and expensive things out there. They can take your life or someone elses in an instant, and they can put you in debt quicker than you know! Limitng car usage is for you!    ",4
01b9b63,"I think its wrong to use the Facial Action Coding System on students in their classroom. One of the reason i think this way is becuase teachers should not have to use a machine is read their students emotions by simple just asking a student on how he or she feels can get the same results. Another reason is the money for a machine like this is very costy, and not every school could afford a machine like this. Also the machine is and invination of privites and some students might not want their emotions read

Most students are under stress by school work and the could easly be read by anyone and it would be a waste of the schools money to read the emotion of a student. Also the student could be sad, angery, or happy about something totally differant from school work, and that means it could throw the machine off.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools and never should be. Machines should never be able to read emotions.",2

Car ownership is allowed but there are only 2 places to put them in large garages at the edge of the development , where a car - owner buys a space for 40,000 along with a home ( 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars para 2 ). Paris decided to ban driving to clear the air of global cities. ( Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog para 10 ). Diesel was blamed , since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline .

As well in sources 3 & 4 Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota and cars have come to an end with culture. They feel as though when people ride bikes , and trains it can prevent car jams. ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 20 ).The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. In ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 35 ). shows that for example van services can share services to have less cars and less gasoline .

01bb07c,"Dear State Senator,

After conducting studies on the American voting system ,I noticed many flaws. Deciding on presidency is one of the most vital processes in any countrie,so it should be addresed properly. the fact that voters vote not for president ,but they vote for slate of electors,the electors can be anyone not holding public office,and the fact that 17 states were never visited during 2000 only focusing on swing states  are just some facts we must look at when deciding a nations fate.

The fact that voters dont vote for president ,but they are actually voting for electors is should be looked into because the people are not  voting for president .The are voting for people to vote for president .which throughly explains the idea that the majority oppinion of the nation is invaluable to the goverment and our society  .This system is not fair .Nor is this system equal. and nor should this system continue to destroy our beloved countrie .

The electors can be anyone not holding public office .This is one of the most gruesome facts about this topic .Bestowing any dreg of society the honor of being an elector is NOT a good idea .This means when one of us votes for an elector trusting him with the fate of the nation. He could mislead us and vote for any canidate making the whole voting system corrupt and misleading.

17 states were unvisited by canidates in 2000. which leads U.S citezens  to ask questions like:Is our oppinion valuable or even considerd valid ? Do the leaders want to run for the benefit of this countrie or do they want POWER?Do our votes even matter or make a diffrence ?Should we just give up on the corrupt system we must live under today?

Thinking about the subject from the prepective of our founding fathers .They would NEVER want a voting system like ours today were people's oppinions dont matter,With often and misleading corrupt electors  not letting the majority rule .This system should be put to an end ,So our countrie can live free again.                                                                    ",4
01bb2f3,"Are driverless cars safe? Cars have been around for many decades and more to come. Cars are used in peoples everyday life. Cars are developing in many ways. I think driverless cars are not developed because; it's not completely driverless,It's challenging, and the car isn't advance.

Frist, driverless cars are not completely driverless. In the text it says,''this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.'' If the car isn't completely driverless there is no point on getting a car like this. This car can only handle driving functions up to 25mph. This mean the driver needs to keep hold of the wheels.

Secondly, the driverless car is challenging. It means it's hard to drive. Driverless cars are dangerous. It's not even driverless completely. This type of technology is sometime too advance for people. In the text it says, ''drivers have to steer,accelerate, and brake themselves.'' The driver is doing all the work.

Lastly, the driverless car isn't that advanced. In the text it say,''none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' This car tells you bthe simplest thing. In the text it says,'' it notify the driver when there's a work zone and accident.'' This car isn't really that helpful.

The driverless car isn't developed. You still should have a hand of the wheel. This is not yet completely driverless. This car tells you the simplest thing and not advanced. Why would anyone want a car that just tells you the simplest things that you can tell form just looking up at the road.",2
01bd69c,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures.

I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

Also I find it cool how the famous painter ""Da VInci could study human anatomy enoough to help him pain the facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" When I look at the new Mona Lisa painting I do smile and think that maybe she was happy to have taken this picture, I mean we'll never know what she really felt in the painting. All we know is what we see today and thats her smiling.

01c1169,"Anyone and everyone has emotions. There are many different ways a person can feel and how they could express those feelings. But now, there's actually a way a person can ""calculate"" someone else's emotions. Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe, are now developing ways for humans to communicate with computers. To be more exact, they're looking for students to try out this new software. There are many reasons why they should try out this new and exciting innovation in technology.

The most important reason why they should use this software in schools is to see how the student is feeling at school. School is a very interesting and complex place. It can effect students in many different ways for the good or the bad. That is why this software is so important. In paragraph 6, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" As we all know, school can be very boring. This very reason is why an abundance of students aren't doing good in there classes. Administrators could use this information about the students to adjust there learning programs to make the lessons more interesting for the students. The computer can even go beyond classroom problems to mental health issues. School shootings have been a major problem recently and if a computer can detect a student's unhappiness, the school could stop the problem before it even happens.

All in all, this new computer software could help boost student's grades, make learning more interesting, and could even help save lives. ",3

01c46fa,"The article called "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes how a new technology called the facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Here you will find an arguement on whether or not the use of technology to read is the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

Students using technology is a great way for them to express themselves. Once students understand how there technology works they will began expressing themselves through culture, Litilarcery, and so much more. In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it says "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This allows some computer software to recognize emotions.

Facial expressions are a very important detail in every individuals life. Reading someones facial expression can tell you what you need to do next. For example in paragragh 4 it says "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, "" even though individuals oftem show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly)."" So when your friends mad and doesnt want you near her or shes just confused, now you'll know your next step.

Emotions are not just expressions on ones face but body movement as well. Body Language plays an important roll in facial expressions. In paragragh 3 it tells us ""Eckman has classified six basic-emotion shappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movents of the facial muscles."" For example when your angery your orbicularis oris which is the place around your mouth, it tightens your lips up to show your emotion.

The use of technology to read emotional expressions are very important. It not only tells us our emotions but our body language as well. This allows us to tell what another person is feeling rather than ask them.",3
01c5073,"My views on technology being used to read students emotional expressions is, that I am against this idea in certain cases. I feel like this could go agaisnt someones privacy and the way others can view them in certain different ways they did before. I don't believe that people should use technology to figure out if someone is feeling sad, happy, angry, confused etc.. because it is there privacy and not for anyone else to know unless you tell them so.

Another reason I can give is that the technology is almsot pointless when we can do this ourselves, they say it themselves ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the simple look on their face"" The technology isnt needed when we can do this with our very own two eyes, The point of the techhnology is to give an accurate hypothosis of how we are feeling when we can give that just by talking to someone. There has been times where I've been texting people and know what there emotions is like just by texting them, when we get to know someone well enough we can sense if something is bothering them. This technology on the other hand takes that part of building a relationship with someone to a lower level, you would already know their emotions even in the classroom.

The last example I have is the fact that people can fake there emotons and people do it all the time. It is a tendency and human nature to put on a mask to hide if we are sad or hurt by something because at times we dont wanna hurt people. We could hide the way we feel all we want, because the computer doesnt know whats on the inside, it knows whats on the outside, which in another example in the first sentence saying ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" That is an example of the Leonardo Da Vinvi's ""Mona lise"" the question I have is how do we know thats how she actually feels? He doing a portait not telling her to show how she really feels while he paints. What I am getting at is, it is easy to put on a mask when everything does feel okay.

In conclusion, I don't think this technology is a bad idea, but I feel like it is not needed when we can figure it out just as much the computer can, just maybe not as on point so to speak, but it is someones privacy and not anyones elses unless the person chooses to say.",3

This made me feel curious of knowing more about it, One day knowing what scientist have discovered in planet Venus could be something amazing.

The danger that comes along with worth studing venus seems better not to try to move on with our lifes and stop trying to explore venus. But has that stopped people doing amazing things despite the danger it comes along with it? People have climbled all the way to the top of

Mount Everest being the biggest mountain on earth, coming along with danger with involving death or getting your hand or leg getting cut off because of the low temperatures. People going through the heardest things in life but later on succeding even when getting discriminated or getting yourself killed. But then you are known to being the most inflentual person on earth. All those things turned out to be amazing things, that know matter the consequences or danger it's better to try then not haved tried. There is something that will come along the way to get there. In evidence "" Another project is looking back to an old technonolgy called mechanical computers.

Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."" So that's a step to trying to get to know more about it. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

Even though we been on earth for a thousands of years, But we are just getting to know or discover more things even out of our planet earth. Curosity is always on are minds for an example how many candies do you think are in that jar? or how did you make that object fit when it seems impossible to make it fit, and many more that makes us wanting to know more.

01c5e87,"No, i do not agree with America creating ""driverless"" cars . Depending on a machine to navigate the roads and sucessfully take you to your destination is an accident waiting to happen litterally. Who would be at fault if a wreck were to accure? Would you really be able to have piece of mind while letting your car do the driving?

First, you have to think about who would really be at fault if an accident happened. In the article it states that ""if technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" Well it would be challenging to understand that fully, because if something were to happen with one or more sensors malfunctioning, than how can you blame the driver in that case? The maufaturing companies would have to run numerous tests and double check to insure that all of the sensors and gadgets on the vehicle are in working order and stay that way so they deliver a safe product on their part. At the time of the wreck, you will have to take into concideration what each driver was doing, and the steps leading up to the event to come to a conclution of who fault it is.

Secondly, the cars arent 100% driverless, you still have to take over the wheel when need be. When in these cars, the driver has to give his/her full attention at all times, so you might as well be in an ordinary vehicle. A quote from the text states ""their cars have driven more than a million miles without a crash but sofar, Google's cars arent trully driverless; they alert the drivers to take over the when pulling in and out of drive ways or dealing with complicated issues, such as navagating through road work or accidents."" Having to take over when their is a contruction zone or driveways etc, is not the deffinition of a full driverless car to me.

lastly, the cars have fancy sensors and other tools and whatnot , but these cars still call for human skills. Driverless cars are intelligent but may not be able manage a situation if you were to look down at your phone quickly or something else along the lines of that. The information states that ""they can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. You have to stay focused on the road and guide the car if needed in a situation. if you want to not stay locked on the road and do another thing while in the car, these vehicles are not for you.

In conclusion, i do not approve of these inventions until it is proved that they are 100% safe and until you dont have to pay attention to driving the whole time. Driverless cars still need the skill of a human behind the wheel, they arent fully driverless and something may not work in proper order, and also you have to think about who would be at fault if a wreck happened. These are all things we need to take into concideration before going out and purchasing one of these new vehicles.

01c8f7a,"today i will be writing an essay on this machine called FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System it can read emotions from people in paintings and people that actually move it can tell you their emotions which i think is incredible in all but you can't just look at people's emotions without them knowing what your doing.

Most humans can already tell how our friends, family and other people are feeling just because we can look at them and tell how their feeling its as if we already knew hoow they felt just by the look on their face.

Everybody has an expression that shows how the feel each day a couple of genious's made an invention that changed the world it can tell you how a person is feeling in many different ways but they do it so everybody knows what they are feeling even though they might or might not know.

Everybody feels different emotions some might even be depressed because of maybe a loss of a family member or a best friend so might be angry because of many different things everybody have different emotions me i had depression for a long time and it took me a little bit to realize theres more to life than just sorrow or depression just move on and just try and find someone who makes me happy theres this girl that makes me happy we aren't dating but she gives me hope for the future as i said everybody is different.

So for my conclusion i think they should keep using the machine to study are feelings it may be helpful in the future so we know how to deal with it thank you for reading my essay.",2
01cbe3d,"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods.

A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA.

The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race.

01d0836,"The challenge of Exploring Venus is that Venus sometimes called the Evening Star because is the one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Sometimes people called the Earth twins because Venus is the cloest planet to Earth term of density and size. Between Venus and Mars is the sun because there sun goes in different speed. Venus can be a challenging because of the clouds and of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.

This shows that Venu's has a thick atmosphere of almos 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venu's temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what thet experiene on our own planet. The other thing is that Ven's has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our system. Beyond the high pressure and the heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediment like erupting volcanoes, pwerful earthquakes.

Venus can be a chanllenging because in Venus it has powerful earthquakes and also erupting volcanoes it's dangerous to be there because the temperature has the hottest surface of any other planets. Venus can be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

However Venus can be ship obriting or hovering safly far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because of the most forms of the light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. People cannot take samples of rock or gas or anything else from a distance. They are challenging many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to there knowledge if Venus.

Now NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. They are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. There other project is called the mechanical computers. These devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940w during World War ll. All modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick, but they are tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

Venu's has been the challenge it has been a value, but not only becuase of the insight to be gained, but also that human curiosity will likely lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors. There travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited because by the dangers and doubts. It's really dangerous to be in Venu's because you never know what will happen in that planet.     ",2
01d2df1,"The Future of Driverless Cars

Could you think about yourself not having to worry about driving your car anymore? This is becoming a possibility with all the new technology automobile companies are using to make this happen. But, there are some people that are opposed to this idea becasue of some problems that could come from this This idea also has a majority of supporters too which myself is one of them. There is some bad things about it dealing with traffic and accidents but there is stress relief for not having to drive and not worrying about the road. Also you would be able to do whatever you want while the car is driving to your destination.

I support the idea of the self driving car for many reasons that will soon help all drivers. ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" With the cars technology ability to be able to mimic the human driver is a huge factor for self driving because it can do all the driving that a human does normally. Some people especially hate driving because it casues them stress and anger so I think if every car was self driving there would be no problems, no traffic, and no accidents to worry about. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This quote is talking about how only few states let companies test autonomous cars which hinders the developement of the cars and their safety for all of us because how can you make a better car if you cant test in in real situations. This is a problem with the testing becaus ethe car cant become better and solve the problems if there is not testing done.

On the other hand of the argument there is many things still wrong with the cars and their saftey. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a big problem witht he cars because technology usually fails at some points in time and if this causes a big accident and people are hurt it will cause so much frustration and confusion on everyone invloved. Another point about the problems of the car is ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" The quote has a big meaning because whats the point of having self driving cars that you need to worry about while its driving? ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The whole point of the self driving cars is its ability to be able to do these things so it should be able to switch could be developed later on.

So in conclusion the self driving cars in my perspective are a good idea but it will come with soem complications as does everythign else. This would be a huge step for the human race and would benefit alot of people. The technology will grow and the problems will become less until we have reached the point where there is no problems with the cars and their abilities.      ",4
01d6e7e,"The 'Face' on Mars is just a hoax. It seems as though the mound on this planet is just a mesa. If you don't believe me, then listen to me very closely. The very similar face on the side of Mars can be very defining but not a single astronout have researched at the Mesa up close and personal. But even if it was made by aliens, it still wouldn't tally up right?

The 'Face' was first noticed in 1976 by Viking 1 spacecraft, circling around Mars, after trying to find its sistership, Viking 2. As Viking 1 was circling around, it spotted a likeness to the human face. And the mound was found in Cydonia, a very well-know area on the Red Planet to house mesas. As the years went by, they looked more into the mound and Scientists concluded that it was just another mesa, but this moutain-like hill had shadows that resemble the human face.

As you review this very peculiar picture, you can see that it just resembles Earth, mostly in Western America. That certain part of America are very popular for its mesas and buttles (which are the same as mesas). There may be more out in the solar system, mnaybe even more in the whole universe itself, but in the end of all the discoveries, they all end up being coincidences. Maybe one day, we'll find extre terrestrial life, but for now, we will just make more and more discoveries until we don't have anything else to find.",3
01dabde,"Work. School. Party. No matter what you have on your to do list you still have to get there, so why are car sales going down and how is it benificial to our society? Teens and young adults can often be heard discussing what brand of car they one day hope to buy and all the modifications they will make to 'trick it out'. Many people though end up being 20 or older before they actually get that car they always talked about, and despite parents claim of laziness there could be more to it then that. So what advantages could there be to a  world with fewer cars on the road?

The first topic that is at the forfront of the minds of most people just starting out their new life is cost. The world revolves around money, thats just the way it is, so many people are finding themselves cutting out things that they don't really need. Now I know what your thinking but before you begin your argument that you really need that blue mercedes you saw in the magazine think about just how much that cost compared to your last paycheck, not so exiting anymore right? With public transportation becomingh more and more avalible many people are choosing to take the public bus rather then buy their own car. Another thought is all those taxes you pay. What you thought they went to police and teacher's wages and building nice little parks for the kiddies? Well acording the Environmantal Protection Agency 80% goes into making Highways and other transport, and why do they need that much money? Because we drive 100 tons over them every day. Many of the more polluted citys are even begining to put laws into place banning or restricting traffic in some areas and placing fines on those who violate them. Between the purchase price and matnence as well as gas and the money used to fund roads and highways theres a lot of dough pouring into your car drives.

Now heres the topic I know your all tired of hearing about but its still very important, the environment. Car emmisions are the second biggest source of polllution in the atmosphere, first place going to powerplants and third place being cows, yes cows. Is a world blanketed in smog and smoke where the very air that sustains you is poison the kind of place you want to live in or, for that matter, raise kids in? Its not the the planets health we're talking about here its the health of everything living on it including us. While we're on the topic of health one of the greatest health issues in America is obesity, now imagine if everyone left their cars at home and walked or biked instead, the whole country would be healthier then ever before. And you know how when you go into the country the air smells so nice and clean, well that could be the city too if we just cut back on emmisions, we could have nice fresh air as well. Now think of your children, or friends or even yourself, just outside playing football when a car comes by and almost hits you, dozens of people die every day in car crashes that wouldnt if there were less cars on the road. So think of the health of your familly, your friends, your pets, and yourself.

Finally we have the cultural shift, many Americans are already choosing to carpool take public transport or even just walk and less and less are buying cars. This trend is so noticibly prominent that car companys are trying to come up with new ideas and products to keep their customers coming. Citys are coming up with new systems of bike and car borrowing as well as a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and imporve safty"". So for those of you that can't stand to be left behind by the times jump on the band wagon and you can do your part to bring about a new cleaner era in the world.

Cars, the parasprites of a modern age, keep multiplying and destroying more and more. The emmisions given of by these monstrosities will linger more many a milenia poisoning the air we breath and devastating the world out children will inherit. Unless we do something to stop it now this travesty will continue to ravange all life on the planet untill we are on the brink of extinction, so do us all a favor and help to push this new trend of a car free world.

01e0bb8,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling? With this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, it is truly possible. You can detect the emotions people are feeling through this technology advancement.

Using this new technology serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other forms of technology.

To begin, the facial recognition technology serves great purpose and value because it unlocks new discoveries in our history. With this being said, new beginnings are coming about because we know more about how Mona Lisa was feeling while Da Vinci was painting this famous portrait that is spoken about all across America. It gives insight on the deeper meaning of this painting. For example, we now know that Da Vinci must have studied the human body in order to create such a wonderful piece of artwork. In the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" Due to his great knowledge of the human body and muscles he was able to paint precise emotions and because he painted such precise emotions, people today were able to unlock how she felt during this time. A new discovery. After all, this advanced tech can now bring this history piece to life. In the text it states,""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This creates a new perspective of how we view our history and it also could unlock mysteries in our histories past.

In addition,this technology advancement was created only to help people. As consumers, we always think about, what would this do for me? With that being said, the Facial Action Coding System could have a positive affect on our medicines, entertainment, and medical technology. In the text it states,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery."" The one thing I think about when I hear America is sports, which is a form of entertainment. The new technology could benefit our use of televisions and radios or smartphoneswhich we watch sports on. Another thing I think about it when someone is speaking about this country is medical purposes. Our country has amazing medical advances and technology. The facial coding could help create a better understanding or a better alternative for complicated technology. Then again, as consumers we also spend alot of time on social media or looking at ads. Sometimes there are things we are not interested in at all but they annoyingly still pop up. With the facial coding, our faces can be detected if we like the ad and if we do not like the ad. This benefits us greatly because it shows what we do want to see and what we do not want to see. In the text it states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown,the next ad will be different."" Many might say this does not matter but ads are everywhere and our world is only going to rely on computers, or other forms of technology so why not embrace it and try to advance too?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other technology. ",4

The reason why the author would want to go back to venus is to see what happend to it but the reason humans have not been back to venus in nearly 3 decades is because the rovers cant take the preassure and heat on the planet and break in 30 or less minutes.

Humans want to go so they are making prototypes of diffrent things like a blimp like vehicle that would stay 30 miles in the air that would study but the problem with tht vehicle is that no light can penetrate throw the clouds so they couldnt see anything. but they might you something called a mechinacal computer that dosnt need a battery it is operated with gears and levers so it could with stand harsh enviorments. the reason we we cant use a computer for example is because the elctronics would melt and imploud because of the emensece preassure on the surface of venus.

The electoral college is not a good idea. Voters really dont get to vote for the President . A slate of electoral is the person to elect the President. This system is called a disaster factor , the U.S. should be lucky the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. There are also people that want to stay with keeping electoral college . The electoral college restores most of the weight on the political balance that by population in large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. The canidates dont spend time in the states they know theres nochance of winning. Its a winner takes all kinda thing. In the 2000 campaign about 17 states didn't get to see there canadidates at all . States like Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campaign ad.

Here is some information on the electroral college ,Every 4 years the presidential election is held on the Tuesday after the first monday inNovember. You can help choose your state's electors when you vote for President . When you vote your actually voting for your candidate's electors. The electoral college has 538 electors. 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. After the election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertinment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate also declares the winning canidate in your state.

State legislatures are responsible for picking electors. In the 1960's segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratice electors with new who would oppose John F. Kennedy.  in 1960 also Hawaii sent in 2 slates of electors to congress . Luckily , Vice President Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate validated his only opponet's electors.

The electoral congress should not be used it's unfair . It should be changed to be the popular vote for the president in the U.s. . It's unfair to the people there not really voting.                                      ",3

The landform on Mars is a mesa, and there are many like it on Earth. As the text states, ""It remids me most of Middle Buttein the Snake River Plain of Idaho...""

As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This means that if there were tools, construction equipment, or anything

from ""extra terrestrials"" that they would be visible in the picture. There was nothing there but landforms and rocks.

In 1998 the best picture taken was when Mars was foggy and skeptics and theorists said that markings could be hidden. But in 2001 a new picture was taken and it showed that the landform only had the markings the rest of the planet. The red dust and rocks.

The landform on mars in natural, even if it looks like a face. You can see things closeer up in a digital image, there are many equivilent landforms on Earth that are natural, and lots of theories on the face are exagerated. Before you speculate, have your facts straight.   ",4
01f5682,"Dear State Senate,

I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States prsident because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine,  the text says, ""... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters  would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Paragrapgh twenty-three, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.                             ",5

That is not good imagine a (NASA) researcher going to venus to get information they would not even make it back because of how hot it is. Venus is something were people should not go. Also in the text it says that ""Venus would not allow scientists to float above the fry"". That quot from the text is very important because it is clealy warrning you that it is dangerous.

Venus is not very safe for humans/researchers. In the story it says that "" beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seekinhg to land on its surface"". Just reading that littke sentence you can tell Venus is no joke it is very dangerous. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration would not even send a human to study Venus.

In the story the author talked about sending mechanical computers to Venus to get the information they need. That would be very smart to send old technology

(Mechanical computers) insted of humans it would be way safer. In the story the author states that ""These divices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"".

So I belive that if these mechanical computers did the job back in 1940s then it can do the job now because we have better technology no then we did back then. Also it states in the story that ""modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicaye when it comes to extrem phisical condidtions"". If they send these computers they can really get their information andit would save more human lives because then the humans would not have to go to Venus toget the information they need.

In conclusion Venus is dangerous, its not safe for humans to go up to venus and they are thinking about sending tecnology computers to get information.",3
210900,That technology would not help in schools because the fact that students are sometimes not happy with how computer ads put up. Teacher can also see how their students are feeling on the computer but one flaw about this is that what if it didn't work. The technology would have to have many updates to get the system right and make the experiance better. Someone can hack that computer and can be watching you or the government might be trying to watch us. How much is schools going to be paying for these compter? Maybe around a million dollars in buying and fixing it. Most schools don't have good internet or they have bad students that might break these computers and the school or stduent would have to pay for it. The computers schools have now barely even work now so why buy a computer that most likely not going to work no better than the computers they already have. Why take away a ad and putting a new ad is going to make a student happy? What if they dont like ads at all? what is the point of the putting a computer that can read people emotions by scanning their face and the students are not going get any happier they are going be excited about at first and then get bored with it. Computers are not good for kids at a young age they will get addicted to being on a computer won't go outside and then they are going to gain weight and then be fat. ,2

Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. This is all I wanted to tell you , I hope you listen to what I'm trying to tell you. I know I am not the only one that thinks like this. If you would like to contact me back you could email me at EMAIL_ADDRESS. Thankyou and have a great day!

021271e,"In the article it states that a "" Long time ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today ."" This shows that Venus wasonce probably just like how earth is today . You couldve probably lived there and made a whole new life there . Also the text says "" The planet has a surfave of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This shows how Venus is just alike to earth and that maybe we should consider exploring Venus more.

The idea in the article that they came up with is that they wanted us to imagine a ""vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles abover the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level om Earth."" This is showing that humans can possibly live on Venus . Its not ""eady conditions"" to live in but they can. They should explore Venus some more and come up with a idea so people can possibly start a life there. This would benefit a lot of people because what if something really bad happened to earth then people could stay on another planet and we can have Venus as a back up plan if anything goes wrong .

In conclusion, NASA should consider exploring Venus because its would benefit a lot of people. Having another planet to live on would possibly lower the population on earth and would make it easier for everyone. It can also be a ""backup planet"" incase anything happened to the planet earth and lastly we can see how it is to live different as surive in a different planet . ",3
0220c9f,"This article about the Facial Acting Coding System could be valuable. Though it may not be exactly needed it could be used when looking at a criminal and seeing what emotions they are hiding under the fake smile or crying face they have. This facial coding system could be used to help students who are struggling and what help but cant get the nerve to ask for it. Since technology is becoming a way of life this is just another step forward to becoming closer to computers and for them to understand us better.

In paragraph 1, It showed an example of Mona Lisa. In paragraph 5 it talks about how Da Vinci would study human anatomy to help him paint facial muscles precisely to show true emotions. For them to do Mona Lisa was brilliant because everyone knows who she is and Da Vinci studied human anatomy to show strong emotions. This could be valuable to schools because students make it hard for other students to show their true emotions. By using this facial coding systen teachers and administration could see what students are truly struggling with. It could be their math homework or maybe a problem with family. They could see their emotions in the computer while at home and at school to see how they act differently. This system could make school a more welcoming and fun to place to come to. In paragraph 6 it says this computer technology could make a boring lesson more interesting to the specific student. Every student has different like so this would be very valuable to schools.

Through this all it would be valuable for schools to invest in this product because it would make the school more fun for students and allowing them to learn more by the facial system allowing them to recognize what makes them happy and what makes them annoyed or bored. It would also be valuable to buy this because students could have fun learning about it and seeing how it works and may show them what they want to do in the future by showing what the future may turn out to be with new technology.",3

I got to see Europe and China. My friend and I got to help a lot of people during our time, too. There is also time to play around on the boats after you unload all the animals. I loved to play volleyball and baseball. Also, we played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

The program helped open up my eyes. It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It might be a little hard at first ,and rough, but you'll get the hang of it. After all that, just think of how good you'll feel after knowing you've helped people. Signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity for you.

226250,"In this article Driverless Cars are coming i agree with them. It would be nice to have cars that can help us drive or even drive for us. First that would be really good for peoplewho drink and drive. Then it would be the same for

people who are tired from work or an type of activity and cant drive because there just so tired.Plus i feel its a good investment in our country, instead of getting a taxi.

First i think its a good idea because the people who drink and drive now have this driverless car to take them home. There friends dont have to worry if he or she made it home safetly cause there is this car that is

keeeping them safe from driving. They wont hurt anybody or themselves. Also if they do try to drive and put there hand on the wheel maybe they should have the car sense there is too much alchahol in there system.Like how paragraph 4 said that ""they will needed a

whole lot of sensors"" for the car so maybe then can put a sensor like that put in the car.

Then the people who are tired from work and from doing something very tiring or the people who cant see even at night

and they suufer from driving and they end up up a car crash so the car can help

them out a lot because many people suffer from not seeing in the dark when they drive. Or when you

go grocery shopping and your reallly tired and cant really much for yourself the car is there for you to take you home.

Last, its a good investment for our country in paragraph 1 they mention that

""the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibllity than a bus."" so i feel why not take up that offer when there is so many companies out there that offer a taxie system, so we can replace all of that and save more money in this counry and possibly other contries. having to pay for a ride from and back can burn your pockets when you can use half that with the driverless car. I feel you can save so much more money that way ecespically when you use the taxi sytem everyday. when you think about it thats thousands a year. So i say just invest in the car and it would be better for you and me

in the the end.

In conclusion i think that driving driverless cars are good with me im totally with it in the end.",4
0226c11,"The face on Mars is a natrual landform created on the planet. Some people believe it was created by aliens or that's an alien artifact around the planet. The face that we see in the pictures is mostly not possible for aliens to create and for sure there are no tracks of any alien life around.

In the article it says There was no alien monument after all. This explains my answer by saying that the face was created naturally and not an alien artifact. Also in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars it explains another reason to show that the face on Mars is just a natural landform created by the planet in the article it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West"". This also explains my answer by comparing the natural landforms on Earth and comparing it to the face on Mars. The third reason to explain why the face on Mars

is a natural landform is in the beginning a reason to why people think it's an alien creacted landform or artifact is because of the pictures where not made clear enough during 1976-1998. After getting the 2001 picture it's easier to see that it only creates a face when there are shadows.

The picture taken in 2001 can also make it clear that it has a natural form for example it's not perfectly shapped and it has a few cracks almost like a rock. In the article it says “As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". This explains my answer by explaining how the image taken in 2001 was a better picture of the face on Mars and they could actually work on it better and discover it without any problems to stop them along the way. Also the image taken in 2001 can help explain to those who believe that it was formed by aliens that it was a natural landform created by the planet naturally. The landform that looks like a face on Mars is created naturally by the planet. ",3
2.27E+069,"Cars thery're every where, and people use cars to get from point A to point B. Cars are very important in the lives of many people all over the world. Cars are efficiant and help to get the job done. People often only seem to look at jus the postive sides of cars, but yet tend to oversee the down falls of how the use of cars can have in a persons life. the use of cars many have a few postive aspects but the negatives out way the good. The use of cars effect the enviorment negatively in a big way, also the use of cars tends to cause people stress that a person might not be aware their going through. The limting of the use of cars is something people must take upoon themselves to look at.

The envorement its all around us, it provides us with the basic nesscities we need to survive the envoirment provides us with oxygen that we need to breathe and food that we need to eat. The use of cars is threating the enviorment. Cars realse Co2 or carbondioxy into the enviorment causeing the air to be come polluted. Accoriding to an article tittled ""paris bans driving due to smog"" writen by Robert Duff. Duff writes about how Paris Frances air had become so polluted due to the realse of co2 admsions  that the govenerment had to enforce a band on the use of cars until the smog in the air cleared up. The main casue of the smog in the air was the diesls found in the cars used in France, due the fact that France has a Tax policy that draws towards the use of diesles over gasoline. Accrording to Duffer ""diesels makes up  67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to53.3 percent average of diesle engins in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.""

In the article Duffer explains how the most ppopulated cities are the ones with the the smog or air pollution. Cities like Beijing and China have alot of smog in the air is because of the use of cars. The use of cars have a very negative impact on the enviorment. Countries all over the world are taking a step foward towards limting their use on cars due to effcts its has. In an acrticle called In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars writen by Elisabeth Rosenthal talks about an upscaled coummunity in called Vauban Germany where people have given up theirs cars. In Vauban's 70 percent of the families that resided in vaubans don't own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. Even though alot of the resdients of Vauband dont use car some still due. Ownig a car is still allowed vauband uses large garages where people can  store thier cars,but a person must first pruchase a parking space for $40,000 first. While some cars are still used in the comuntiy walk or bycicle as thier means of transportation. Vauband is a prime example of of a postive growing trend. Vauband helps to reduce the green house gas emissions cars give off.

While cars can cause harm to the enviorment, cars can also cause people stress that they themsleves don't know they're dealing with. Accoriding to a a qoute found in In german Suburb, Life goes on without Car. Heidrun Walter exprees how without casr lifes is happier ""When I had a car I was always tense.

022a010,"I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be slightly helpful, but other than that, not at all. While few would benefit from being taught by a computer, others, not so much.

Dr. Huang said that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe this is wrong, as there is no way of making a student less bored. If you were to add entertainment to the mix of the lesson, then how could the lesson be taken seriously? Teachers tend to add their own spice to lessons that, both, make the students laugh, and become more interested in the lesson. No computer could mimick a human's humor. A computer also would not be able to explain things as well as a teacher could. A computer could modify the lesson as many times as it could, but the student would still be confused. A teacher would be able to explain things better and make it simpler than a computer could. It would also be quicker.

It is proven that students learn better with paper and a physical learning environment. Sure, a computer would know more and be able to explain things more properly, but knowing this fact... Would it even be worth teaching the student if they won't even remember it? Technology would also completely replace the need to write down notes by hand. With a physical environment, you also learn life skills. For example, knowing when to speak and ask questions, manners, and getting along and working with others. These skills are often used in work environments.

And, what about those who have no access to technology? Poverty and homelessness are still big in the world. Sure, your child could participate in a physical environment at a school, but why would there be a need for schools if it is all on the computer? It would also be cheaper for school officials to have computers than to have teachers that require a weekly or monthly pay, and to not require supplies for the children as well. It would quickly spiral into a ""be rich or be homeless"" world in an instant. A lot of stress would be put on the backs of many people who wish for their child to get an education. We already give these people a hard time, why given them an even harder time, and even include their children?

In conclusion, a lot would be wrong with using the Facial Action Coding System in schools. Very few would benefit from having such advanced technology instead of teachers and a physical environment, but the rest would be disadvantaged.",5

Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When he finally got there he helped on his Aunt Katie's farm. He went on a second trip. The cowboys all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowboys. The cowboy, also known as Luke Bomberger, lead his family to host a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many years. They arrivred in China August 14, the day the Pacific war ended. I bet his family was very proud of him. When he turned 18 I bet he was excited because he could be drafted for miltary service. Then when his board learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to just keep doing that for service.

My friend and I both signed up.

We joined the group because we knew it would be an experience of a lifetime. We also wanted to help people and animals in need. It felt so good to be able to be called a hero.

Another good thing about it is that you can travel around the world and the states like if there are more animals do in need because they are in danger and almost extinct!

The best part is that you go out around the world and help out everything and if you are in the news for that and the people see that you were on the news with all of you friends then they might as well congratulat you.

Once they see that people can do that to world then they might want to join because they to. When you around the world that means you might go to Asia and a lot of places that were very good in need like China,Japan,Mexico,Australia, and the best for helping out animals is probably Antartica.

People might say wow that bad because it's really cold there and that Therese really nothing we can do there but there is. You can help the endanger Penguins and sea lions that are there and bring more food for them and ever since the globe warming went up Antartica is slowly melting but then getting more snow but the heat are killing penguins. Maybe go to the polar and save some Narwhals or some other animals like polar bears.

So go around the world helping Elaphants,Penguns and also rhinos or just a lot of animals and other counterinsurgency that are helping animals and build more thing for them like China and the pandas and make more cities or homes for the homeless.

That is just one of many very well told reasons in the article that the author provided to state why we should keep studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. THe author provides information that pushes people to want to know more.

In the article the author provides us with information on the ways how humans have studied Venus. In the the article the author tells the reader how humans have sent a lot of spacecrafts to study Venus but no spacecraft survived for such a long time on just landing on Venus. The author expalins that that is the reason to why no furthur studies have been made in over three decades.

Another thing of information that the author provides the reader with is to why the atmosphere is challenging for us. In the article the author provided the reader with information like the degrees and pressures of the atmosphere. In the article it is said to be over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on earth. Also on the discovery on the thirty plus miles abover surface tempatures change to 170 degrees and the pressure changed close to the sea level on earth giving the impression that its survivable for humans. This discovery make scientists want to know more on why that is the case, leading them to keep making new discoveries no matter the challenges it brings them.

The last thing the author provides its readers is with imformation on what NASA is working on to know more about Venus. The author states how NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus. They are working on simplified electronics which some have in fact worked and have lasted for three weeks. It has studied and has gathered more information.

023c138,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pullution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraunts and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change.""

Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the enviornment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to excercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the enviornment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to excercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.    ",4

To begin with, there were many ""disaster factors"" in the system for the electoral college. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Best-Laid Defenses of the Systems Are Wrong"", it states that back in 1960, segregationists almost succeds in putting in new electors to oppose John F. Kennedy. Also, it states that there are ""faithless"" electors that refuse to vote for their party's candidate which is pretty sad. There are more reaons why we should bann the electoral college.

Furthermore, population is a big factor also in the electoral college. ""In Defense of the electoral college: Five Reasons to Keep Our Despised Method of Choosing the President"" It states that the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance of large states. It's wrong because the big states are the ones that need that population in order for the candidate to win. It's pretty fair to do it by popuation because it depends on that specific person on which candidate is gonna win, not by the state.

That leads to the fact that electoral votes are not the same as voters voting for the president. Many presidents lost the election just because of the electoral college. Personally, it's not fair that a candidate can't become president just because of the electoral college. it even says it in ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wong"". It states that voters do not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors that will elect the president. Nobody knows if that person is loyal or not.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be banished from this country. It is a terrible system that had many ""disaster factors"" in it and also there are people that are elected that are not loyal to their party. If we don't stop it now, who knows what will happen to this magnificent country. If we keep the electoral college as our system, maybe our country will go downhill, so r you willing to abolish it for the greater good?    ",3
024a3bb,"I think this 3-D computer software that can recognize emotions can be used very good because we could tell if somone isnt happy and when there mad ,it can be used for students when they are confuse or bored in school.

This computer software can help kids that are falling into depression not fall into it how? You could use it on them and see if they are depresse and they could recive help from adults. This can also let you know when someone isnt in the mood such as being mad or sad.

This 3-D

software can also help kids in a classroom. It can be downloaded in your computer and you could be reading a passage and your confuse,it could make the lesson modify and make it less confusing on the student. It could also be used for video games or video surgery.

This is why i think its a good idea to have this computer software because it can help students in school if there confuse or bored ,and it can help kids when there depresse and mad or just not in the mood.   ",2

Also using ''video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movments - in a real face or in the painrted face of Mona Lisa.'' It can define the emotion of a real human and in a painting. There technology is very intresting they construct a 3-D computer model to the face. instead of humans trying to find out calculations them selfs they can use the new technology. Humans can perform the same way as the new technology even tho they are gonna have to estimate the percentigs. Also can tell when children or students are tired or bored or falling as sleep so then the technolgy '' could modity the lesson, like and effective human instructor. The same technology can make computers-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery.'' so it can keep the students on track and still learn on there school lessons and wont get behind. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emtions. Students can change there face exprishions but the new technolgy can tell that not there real expertion.

262618,"""Unmasking the face on Mars""

You will be wondering what theirs a face on Mars,well we do not know for sure. Some scienitst are saying that the ""Face on Mars"" are provided from aliens (Aliens are living in Mars?). They discover the face in 1976,that is when they took the photo they lastest image is from 2001. Also another scientist are saying (am one of them) that ""It is just a rock"". It has natural grow & its not a mask & just a rock. But who knows no one knows.

Did you know that 50% of scientist think that it is a mask from aliens & the other 50% of scientist think it is just a natural landform. ""A few days later NASA unveilded the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation. . .which resembles a human head. . .formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes,nose & mouth."" And i still think it just a rock,if it were an aliens face or an human face tell me how did it got their.

Do you still think that its still their (i do so) because it is a rock,rocks dont die,they are hard rocks we have & they never die. But am not that convience how can a rock change by its years,but also maybe because it is a different type of rock (its in the space) I thinking that the rock changes by the time.

Its just a rock that looks strange dont all rocks look strange they are all unique & some strange ones they are a lot of type of rocks in the life,dont think the the rocks are the same. Were different.",2
026355a,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you may get to see new sights. You may also play fun and exiting games while your off shift or while going on the return trips. You can also help out with fun things like feeding the animals or be put on night shift.

The sights you get to see could be amazing. The thing you get to see could be amazing. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see all types of new things like new fish or new landscapes. Some off the landscapes you might not be used to, but that means that you could enjoys the veiw! As your out on the sea you can see fish that you might of never seen before. You could also see reefs that are colorful and bright!

When your on the ship it could get quite borning. You might want to do something fun. Well on the return trip you get to play all the games etc. you want. Some games for when your in the mood for somehting sporty you can play baseball and volleyball where their are empty holds where the animals were kept. You can also play table tennis, fencing, and boxing. After you played the sports you might be ready for a relaxing game such as board games or cards. If your not into those kinds of things then you can just read or whittle. There is always a fun option.

When there are tons of animals on the ship there is always work to be done. To help out you can feed the animals and/or clean their stalls. You could also pull up bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. When you feed the animals you have to feed and water them 2 or 3 times a day. To be extra helpful you could help clean. It may not be the funnest job, but it helps a lot. When we get to our destination there are tons of animals to load off the ship. You coild help unload them or if we are back at our returning place you could help load the animals and all the supplies into the ship.

Those are only some of the reansons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Its a lot of fun, but it can be hard sometimes. You may get hurt, but thats okay. Thanks for your time.",4
264158,"In the article,""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there is an abdunant amount of reasons why these cars with the idea of driveless cars is absolutly absurd. The idea for the car itself is a ton of money just to build it. Then to add ""smart-roads system""(3) would add thousands of more dollars to go to waste. If the money issue is not a concern, then what about the idea of still having to assist a car that is suppose to be ""driverless""?

The cars themsevles would cost a fortune to make but ""smart-roads systems""(3) would cost too much money for anyone person to pay. Now the car itself would be too much money because of the need of so many sensors. With an estimated guess, there would have to at least 11 different types of sensors to be place in one car. Even with thousands of dollars going into the driverless cars, they still have not found a way to have a completely driverless vehicle. Different cars call for different driver's assistance. Some ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel,""(7) while others will send a signal to the driver such as, vibrating the seat, announcing to driver that they ""should be prepared to take over""(7), and others have flashing lights. Which means that in no way is this car driverless if it some how requires the drivers help with driving.

These cars would cost one person, a lot of money that they do not have. Even the safe-road system that has not even been made would cost even more then the car itself. If that was not enough, then what about the fact that these cars are not driverless... the driver still needs to help driving. These reasonings just help with the understanding that these cars is just something that is not needed in this world.",3
0269b85,"The picture shows a face but how long ago was that picture taken, 1976 was when the first picture was taken. In 1976 they had a camera with pixels thats not so good. The picture was taken like there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gound or Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were. It was taken 43 meters away.

In 1998 the picture was taken again and the camera was getting better and better. The 1998 picture looks more clear then the pitcure that was taken in 1976. Over time the picture got more clear. 2001 the picture was taken again and it was taken 2.5 km-wide stripes away. This time it didnt even look like a face. The Middle Butte looks like a snake from in the air but doesnt make it a snake. You saying aliens made that too the way the water moved made it like that .

So facts show that at one point it looked like a face but wasnt done by alien the way the picture was taken is the reason why. You could use the moon as an example. Everyone use to think there was a man in the moon just by the way it looks but clearly there isnt a man in the moon.

0273b7b,"Venus is often referred to as the ""twin"" of earth. It is the second closest planet to the sun. Space crafts have been sent to Venus despite its extreme conditions. There has not been any humans sent to Venus. The last spacecraft was sent was three decades ago. Spacecrafts have not lasted more than a few hours after landing in Venus.

The author of this article suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Astronomers and scientists are fascinated by Venus because it is the most similar planet to Earth. In the article it states that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today Venus has some features that are the same to those of Earth. Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters. Mars and Venus are the closest planets to earth and often times Mars is closer than Venus. Due to the speed, it changes which two planets is closest.

NASA is working on technology that would allow further studying on Venus. One of their solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. This means that they would have something that could fly over the many storms to avoid the bad conditons. This idea is more thought out than the spacecrafts that would have to land and would only last a few hours. Another one of NASAs projects is simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

The author does have some convincing details in the article. Though the conditions of Venus do seem harsh and there has not been anymore attempts to send more projects down to Venus in three decades. It does seem like NASA is working hard to get things fixed and ready for a possiblity of sending projects down. The details presented were convincing and it makes a good article. The author is pursuading but the conditions that Venus holds are not convincing.       ",3
279487,"When cars where made by humans they put this device that is to have the car be more alarmed to the driver and everyone else that is in the car, but there are still some cars that are very old and don't have the same menufactors that are placed in the old cars that are like 1800s and 1900s. I think that the old cars should be put into some car meuseum or somthing to remind us how the very first engine car ever work without having a carage that has to have a horse to use as wheels even though that was a very very very very very very long time before even engine cars even excisted in time.

i think that we've impoved on the safety of everyone that is driving and that are still learning to drive and trying our hardest to keep people safe from harm but useally that doesn't happen, we would have some difficulties with the cars that we are using today still needs some work to be done with them. I think it's a good idea to put more control on the car and less for the driver that has to drive the car. The only reason why we build cars and buses and trains and etc is to make us get to things like a if your running late for something and you need to get there really fast you could take your car and get there as fast as you can so your not offically late and not get fired and have to lose your job cause you were late for work.

That's why we have cars to rely on and not our feet the whole time but most times if we dont want to use our car we can always walk there thats somewhere close and not far to walk like the gas station or the park or anything or if your just to dang ""LAZY"" to even walk that far then you would use a car or if you dont own a car you always use the bus to go where you want to go. It's not that hard to spend a little money on a bus toll to get to where you want to go and really it's not that hard at all but if it's for something really important then ""GO BUY A CAR"" i mean yeah cars are exspenive to even afford one but really if you save money then wouldn't have no problem at all on buying a car that has to fit your needs and get to places that you need to go.",1

The face was just a huge rock formation which looked as to be a human head. The head was formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia.

The places you can go such as Europe now thats kind of odd. Of why you you would go in a cattle boat fulled with people you dont know. I'm not saying I would turn down that opportunity but I would think about it for awhile. You dont know where you going to be next you may get a hint or something i wouldn't know but it would be scary if it where myself doing this.

When would you get home? I would always ask myself this quistion if it were me on a cattle boat going to Europe .

Also what was the main reason why I took this opportunity. Was the main reason because it was opportunity of a lifetime. Think it over and find 3 main reasons why you took this opportunity.

I understand why Luck did what he did. What im trying im trying to say here is why he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II. What I dont unnderstand is what was his main reason.

To finish up my dissagrement of why someone like me or even you shouldent do this is, did he even help anybody becaue in the promt it didn't tell wither or not if he did. I would think that was that was the most important thing.            ",2

0293f31,"The Facial Action Coding System is a great achivement in science and technology, but should it be used in your computer at school? There are many reasons why using this coding systam could be a great thing in the class room, or a disaster. As stated in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, if we could put this in our everyday school computers, it could calculate whether or not a student is having trouble with a lesson and change it for them to help them. What are the pros? What are the cons?

Some of the pros to using this coding system in students computers is as stated in the article, it could read the studens facial expresssions and determan if he or she is confused or having trouble understanding the lesson. If it could do this it could change the way the lesson it tought better helping the student understand.

But what if schools dont teach lessons online. For example, my school does not teach lessons online. Our teachers might give us website addresses to look up and use for studying, depending on the teacher. Unlike other schools around me that do E-learning. They either stay at home, or go to school and do a whole days work off of their school issued computers. This Facial Action Coding System would work greatly for those students that do E-Learning, but not so much for the ones that don't.

Secondly, does this system cost anything? If so how much? And do schools really need to spend extra money on a system to be installed in our computers? Schools have gotten along just fine without this for years. Schools did just fine before they were even using technology like computers in the first place. I don't think that we are really in need of something like this. Students using the internet to do assigments always ask questions if they have any. Those students also have internet acsess if they are working on online assignments, so they could also search for more websites to help them better understand.

Another topic listed in the article was using the coding systam to learn if that person was intrested in an add that showed up on their computer or not. I belive that adds are already annoying enough, I do not want a coding systam reading my face and giving me adds that I would be more intrested in. Doing so would distract that person from trying to get their work done. For example, if I was a student scrolling through a website I am using to fill out an assignment for school, I don't want a bunch of adds poping up distracting me from my work. Espesially when its and add that intrests me. If its something that intrestes me, then I'm more likely to click on it distracting me from my work. I sertanly wouldn't want that to happen, and I belive nobody else does either.

Really there are a lot of great points to both sides of the topic, but it is mainly up to the schools if they want to use The Facial Action Coding System or not. They only need to ask themselfs the right questions. Do our teachers teach offline alot? Do we have the money for technology like this? And do our students really want to use this or not?                ",3
296469,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the aouthor presents two both possitive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In which i found that a driverless car would not be a good idea. I found this to not be a well thought out plan due to the technology could fail, the cars can't navigate through work zones or around accidents and human drivers would eventually get bored of sitting there and doing nothing and would want to eventually drive.

First, thing that would be on anyones mind about being in a car that you can not fully control is what if an accicdent was to accour or the car's systems began to fail? Who would be blamed the driver or the company that produced the car? In the article the author states that ""...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fualt- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This proving that when the laws are changed the person whom is at fualt may not at all be fair since it could have been the manufacturer's fualt and not the driver.

Second, reason why driverless cars would not be all the great is because the cars can not navigate throught work zones and accidents, so what goood would a driverless car be when it can not even navigate around everyday issues. In the story it states ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This showing hwo the driverless cars won't be complettely driverless which would then compleicate things for certain drivers and, or the manufacturers in case of a navigation error.

Lastly, drivers would eventually get bored of just not doing anything and would want to drive but would not be able to because there cars would be self driven. Inthe article on paragraph 8 it states ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?..."" This evoctaing how not only would you get bored while waiting since you can do other things while in the car if you have to drive and you are doing somthing which you can't automaticlly take over it could cause and accident and it would not be at all safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea due to the fact that the technology could fail and then who would be at fualt may be a problem or simple unfair. The cars can not go through work zones or accidents so why would you want a driverless car that you still have to drive in case of something like that. Thirdly, drivers would be bored waiting for there turn to drive and if they were to do something else and could not automaticlly take conrol that could cause issues for themselves and other drivers. So why would you want a self-driven car when driving so such so much more fun and better?   ",3
02a059f,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

belives that exploring Venus is a worthy challenge despite its challenges. Based on how they have written this article I can say the that the author succeeded at laying out his claim and evidence.

The author starts off by stating facts about the star in our sloar planet from nicknames, temperature, as well as atmoshpere. The text states "" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"". the author also states "" on the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet"".

Later on in the passage the author starts to ask the reader a

questions and provides answers to them. The text sates"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, then why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"". and answers with "" Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"". This body paragraph is another eason why I believe that the author provided a good claim.

The author then continues to NASA's ideas on further exploring the harsh surfaces of Venus. The suthor states "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"". Then gives more detail about the process. The text states"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"".

The author then discusses the problems about the idea that NASA has come up with and the other possible solutions for exploring Venus's harsh surface. The passage states"" peering at Venus from a ship or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limit insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffectve. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"". The author also states"" NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have laster for three weeks in such conditons. another project is looking back to an old technolgy called mechanical computers"".

Based on the information that i have presented from the author's claim and passage, shows that this claim and evidence is correct and is a valid statement to be made by the author.             ",4

The artical says this in paragrapgh 3 lines 2-3 ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like Human musles. The technology can sense six basic types of emotion. The technology will associate each movement of the muscles with the emotion that would match that certain muscle movement.

emotion is a big part of the human body and so are facial expressions. ""Dr. Paul Eckman""and ""Dr. Huang"" have created a technology to read these emotions. These technology can read emotion from even people that show very low degree of emotion. The mona lisa created by Da Vinci was created to show human emotion. But the mona lisa isnt just happy because she is smiling. The mona lisa shows a whole bunch of emotions and this is saying is that any human can seem like they are happy or sad but really they can be the exact opposite.

02a1c3a,"I honestly think driverless cars are an excellent idea. They could help drivers out a lot and possibly change transportation forever. There are a couple reasons why I believe driverless cars should happen. The first one is that driverless cars will make it easier to travel long distances. That reason is followed by the fact it'd be easier to drive if you have small children in the vehicle. And the last reason I have on why driverless cars should become popular is that there will be a lot less accidents.

The first reason I believe driverless cars should become popular is that it could make traveling long distances a lot easier than it always has been. With a driverless car, you wouldn't have to stop and take breaks due to you being tired. This would reduce the time it took to reach your destination. With the car being able to drive itself, you also wouldn't have to stop and sleep. The car could work on getting you to where you'd like to go and you could get back in control after you were well rested. I know these things seem dangerous and impossible, but I'm sure driverless car companies could come up with things to alert you if need be. Vibrating seats or a loud announcement would be good ideas on how to wake a driver if they are needed.

Another reason I'm convinced driverless cars are great is because it would be a lot easier to drive with small children. While the car is operating itself, you could look back and check on the kids a couple times. If the children were in absolute need of anything, you could take care of it while the car took care of all of you. If, by chance, you're needed to drive while your attention is focused on the children, the car could let you know. Like I said previously, vibrating seats or a loud announcement would work perfectly to get your attention but flashing lights or something like that could work as well.

The last reason I strongly believe that driverless cars are incredible is that there would be a huge decrease in traffic accidents. The driverless cars will always obey traffic laws, (proper steering, accleration, braking). People won't have to worry about drunk drivers as much either, with the car doing most of the work the driver won't be doing anything really. There's also no possible way for a car to be drunk. The last reason I have on why driverless cars would prevent accidents is that you wouldn't have to worry about bad weather unless the car needed you to navigate. Thick snow, rain, sleet or foggy windshields would no longer be an issue if cars could drive themselves.

I firmly believe in driverless cars changing the ways of transportation for good. Driverless cars can make it easier to travel long distances, uncomplicate driving with small children, and prevent vehicular accidents. Without the complications of driving when it isn't the best choice, transportation will be more simple for everyone.",4

'It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover thier food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).' As stated in paragraph 2.

'UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.' As stated in paragraph 2. Luke had made nine trips in two years of ""service."" Luke says in paragraph 5 that ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured am excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China

You have to be prepared for long, rocking, swaying trips. If just reading those words made you sick then I suggest you don't go. 'It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.' Luke had slipped down a ladder and broke a couple ribs, so, he could not do very much heavy work.

'Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and gmaes also helped pass the time.'

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun! It sounds like if I were one I would be pretty amazed and entertained. It opens up the world to you. Luke says in paragraph 9 ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thir needs."" So give it a try. See if you like it. But remember this job requires much hard work and a lot of effort. Hope you enjoy it.",3
02a7cff,"Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions and how easy is for humans identify emotions from another person face to face.

Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because is a new system that is been using with anatomical information to make it easy to identify every single people just looking at some exactly angles on their face. In the text it states, ""...studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" The text also states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. So comouters need to understand that, too."" The text finally states, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for videogames or video surgery."" Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotion because humans uses nonverbal communication every single moment like, if they saw something that they don't like or they don't prefer there face use to make some gestures that even the person don't even know that make that face that had express his/her emotions. The coding that this new computers have his so amazing because demostrates how technology had been make and evolution in so many people and not only people also around the world. But this kind of techology also is not the best because it put your identity in danger because the emotions that you make the computer stores all the emotional expressions and maybe with the time another people will have or find access to this archives.

Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because the face is something that reveals how humans feel just looking at your ayes or your mouth, the face cannot hide nothing. In the text it states, ""It's allabout those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" The text also states."" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" The text finally states, "" To an expert, faces dont't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human expressions because sometimes people likes to be alone when they feel sad, so they likes like to text with other people but the only thing they are looking at is the computer. The computer may been seen how the person is feeling because looks at some exactly angles on their faces to identify they real emotinal expressions of that moment when nobody is looking at them and may stores them so the computer have and example how the person faces looks like when is sad, happy or angry and also when the person is smiling and the smile is force because when a smile is forces always will look like very diferent because the muscles are making other movement, very different when the smile is spontaneousand real.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because have the carateristics that make it unique to identify emotionals expressions and that will be not possible if the help of science will not be there to support this new technology and give some advices to make this possible and valuable for the scientists and the people that are using it to take advantage or for something really helpful witch may be the case for some people that hide their emotions, this technology can be a treatment for them that can show they are not the only ones and with that problem and it is normal but they have to be happy with this new technology that can help them.

02a9d14,"Hi, my name is Luke Bomberger and I'm a Seagoing Cowboy. My experiences have been great. I've visited many places, met new people, and got to see and learn about new things. It's great and I really recomend it to you. You should give it a shot and see how things go.

I got to see the Acropolis in Greece! They were made to honor the Greek gods and are on a big hill, above the whole city. It was wonderful. Although, the gongola ride in Venice, Italy was probably my favorite. It was like a mini cruise in the city streets!

I loved helping out with the animals on the ship. The slippery ladder scared me, but it was totally worth it. Don't break your ribs on the way down like I did. Ouch.

We got to play sports on our free time, which made it even better. There were many things to choose from, such as: baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. We also read, which helped us pass time.

Again, I recomend this job for you. I am greatful for this opportunity. You will enjoy it if you like adventures. Oh, the places you'll see. The things you will do. They're great. So give it a try and tell me how it works out. Thanks! ",3
02ab5d2,"One car, one life, one big accident. That is all the future is asking to develope by continuing to try to improve and inspire people to use ""driverless cars"". I do not think driverless cars should ever become a new big thing for many reasons. They can malfunction on you. They still need assestence if they cant handle a road situation. They might not update any new laws or road changes nearby. There is so many negative reasons and thoughts that appear when thinking about the development of driverless cars.

My first reason to why I am against driverless cars is because they can always malfunction. What if it doesnt see an animal in the road and runs it over will it stop to help, would it starting loosing control? Who knows because your not the one behind the wheel. You could have stopped and saved that poor animal, instead you let your car take control. Also what if it just shuts down? Turns off completely in the middle of the road. All electronics have a point in time where they are slow and slowly begin to shut down. How long would you have the car to keep? Do you think a driverless car can last you up to 10 years? Maybe if your lucky. The weather and the technology cant keep up and hold its together as long as a gas opperated automobile is. What if it doesnt let you take control because it malfunctions and you end up hurting someone? Like it says in the text ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?

Also, what even is the point to have an automotive that still needs you in the car. If its not smart enough to drive without needing your assistence it would be useless. So say you are driving down the street and your texting and letting you car drive on its own. All of a sudden it crashes and hurts other including yourself. It would still be your fault even though you was not the one driving. In other words if you get in a car accident would the police put your car in jail or you? Well you offcorse if your even recovered from the crash your car has put you in anyways. Driverless cars allows drivers to think they can keep their eyes off the road when all reality they have to pay attention and be alert. If you have to have your eyes remained on the roads at all times then you might as well drive, atleast you will be secure and more alert.

Finally the car over all is just a big mimic. People are tying to develope objects with human like qualities. In the text it even says ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Personally I believe being human is special and an automobile can never be as special as a human life. Yes we may love our cars but never as much as one would love there children, friends, or family.

Driverless cars are just an overall bad idea and we should keep our state safe and the people in it. I'm not the only one who agrees. Driverless cars are illegal in most states. In the text it mentions ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" This shows that im not the only one who belives they are not safe and no matter what upgrades and assumptions that are made will not make a driverless car a good idea. Lets be original and stick to the safe way lets avoid the one car, one life, one accident.              ",5
02b6da9,"i think that technology is valuable because you can tell when peoples expressions show they have a emotion like when their eyebrows go up their surprised or if their lips tighten up their angry so that's really cool because you can tell when their mad, sad,happy and thats how people can tell someone is having a bad day or just sad over something really bad so thats why i agree cause i always wanted to know what people are feeling.

this evidence i got it from the article saying that thieir having technology where you can tell what people are feeling inside of them or if their mad at you or other stuff so its really cool that they invented this technology cause now people can see peoples emotions and we could never do that.

the whole point of this article is about inventing a technology where everyone can tell what your emotions are and what your body expresses those are your emotions and thats how people know what your are expressing.",1
02c0440,"The author suortts both ideas it the text he thinks that its smart that people whant to go visit Venus but at the same time he thinks that its very dangers to go too venus. Venus is like earths twin venus haves that same shape, and they even think that venus youse to look like earth. Venus just have diferint was of being its salf like the acid rain, hot temperatures, and even its crazy weathers. I still think that trying to learn about differient plants is not right becuses us as people doint even know adout are oun plant. I still think that we have a lots of time till earth becomes like Veunus.

In the text the author is trying to tail us that "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth is terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in destance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."" Are people in NASA havent even found a way to land in Venu. From the text

""Each preious mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship had touched down on Veunus in more than three decades."" Even for a perion to be there is too dangrues the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fehrenheit. I even think that that we could not live there in Venus cuse of the climates. From the text shown that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly surface acid in Venus's atmosphere.""

Venus's is plant is formed just like earth But just with too much on it. strate from the"" Beyon high pressure and heat, Venusian geologgy and weather present additional impedimments like eruoting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to prodes seking to land on its surface.""

02c1ebd,"I believe that the possible use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is indeed valuable because it can really change how teachers teach the lesson plan, by showing which students auctually know what they're doing and which students are confused. It can also show which students are board and lets teachers know that they need to make the lesson more interesting.

But I do believe that it can go farther than just the class room, the school counclers can use this to tell if someone is having issues or just a bad day. If the student is upset or angry, the counclers could help them by just knowing how they feel. It can also allow the resource room teachers to better understand how their students are feeling and how to help them.

This could help teachers ease up on the work load given to students by showing them how stressed some students are when given a lot of homework, and it can tell teachers when a student is not paying any attention. This can rebuild the relationship between students and teachers by allowing teachers to better know their students needs and limits, as in how much homework they can efficiently get done with out stressing about it. This can also help teachers push back tests by knowing who isn't getting it, or having less things on it because the students are understanding the materal.

I honnestly believe that FACS really is valuable when reading the emotional expressions of students in the class room by; telling the teacher who needs help, also telling the teacher who is board and how stressed the students are, by telling the resourceroom what their students are feeling today and how to adapt to that, and by helping the counclers by showing them who needs to get something off their chest.

I really do believe that this will auctually help students and teachers in the very near future.",3
02cbcbc,"There are many different negavtives and positives when it comes to driverless cars. Knowing the goods and bads about these special cars can be good for the future when investing in one some day. Having a car that can drive itself, communicate with you and your actions, interact with how you drive could be a good thing. What if something was to go wrong? Being able to know how these things works and whats good and not so good about them could, never know, save your life.

These new and improved cars have positive things about them. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a car. Half a million miles is quite a lot without anything going wrong. it goes to show they can be reliable when wanting to drive a greater distance. There is more about these self-driving cars many dont know. Gm had developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in a danger of backing into an object. Therefor, the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Today, we don't exacly know how or what these self-driving cars are going to have in them or how they may run in the future. There are many positive things that have come upon us when investigating in this new invention but what could possibly go wrong? During the making of these cars there is a lot of technology and a whole lot of sensors. While driving thses cars, lets say on the highway, and something was to go out or mountfunction. Yes, it could happen to any vehicle in the world. The only problem is if the car itself is driving and something was to happen would the driver be able to take control or would the car freeze everything up an something bad happen? Google, BMW, and anyone else involved in this think of all the good possible things but there could be so many negatives that could really be lifechanging.

My opinion on Diverless cars is good for the most part. Say you have to drive a long ways and you need a break from driving, the car could take over instead of having to stop at night and drive for you. Its crazy to think that in a few years these cars could become our lives. ""Telsa has projectd 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" ( Driveless Cars are Coming.)

So, as you think more about it, most positive things could also be negative things when it comes to self-driving cars. In a few years havinng these cars could change our lives or make them harder. From the cars driving a half a million miles to having gadgits to help you focus on driving to not so much the technology problems that could cause bad news for a lot of people. Never know, one day we might have cars driving us around instead of us driving them.",4
02cd88d,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, that's a really smart idea right?. The software can see your emotions, six emotions, and facial muscles.

First, the person who made this software was Prof. Thomas Huang, the Beckman institute fro Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who started to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The first subject he wanted to do was Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Your maybe thinking how do u use a software just to find out how someone is feeling well...

In fact, the computer takes the model of the picture or what ever is there,but it must have human muscles in the picture ir 3-D model the human muscles is called ""acton unit"". It only takes in the model if it see's it have forty-four major muscles like a human would have. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman has classified for the software to have six emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness.

Dr. Thomas Huang and his worjkers or friends that helped him with the software made six basic emotins that the human muscles have and made it to where it only workd if it have the 3-D effect with fourty-four human facial muscles witch is every smart.                              ",1

The Facial Action Coding System is a computer software creater of Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the Unviersity of Illinois. That can calculate emotions based of all fortity four major muscles from the human face and classified them as six emotions Happiness, surprise , disgust, fear , and saddness.

For many students it'll be a great experience to open up to the science world to learn further more about the human emotions based of your facial muscle. ""The facial experssions for each emotion are universal"" from Dr. Huang.

It's been founded that the great picture of Mona Lisa painting of Lenardo da Vinci. That Mona Lisa in the art was eighty three percent happy, nine percent digusted , six fearful and 2 percent angry. It's interesting for people to know such little detail from a great iconic peice from old history, where the Mona Lisa was really intended to bring smile to us.

This reaches out for students for are open up in the science world learning about the functions of Prof. Thomas Huang computer software. The computer targets risorius and zygomatic if a smile isn't being truthful of ones smile.

genuinely working on your smiles that help you smile more in a better happy mood.

In concluison the Computer facial emotion scanner is a big vaulable learning for students to learn about the invention of Prof. Huang. Many will know more futher behind the laws of the muscles of facial emotions based of the FACS (Facial Action Coding Sytem) and learn to scan are emotions.   ",2

02d481d,"Dear, Senator

The

Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose

HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,

People would be let down when they find out that  the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they  might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer paragraph 14) It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.    ",6
02d8dd2,"The use of cars today in our modern world is crazy! Everywhere you look there's cars; going down the road, parked in a garage, or on TV. Now think of a world without them...it would be different, wouldnt it? Yes, indeed it would be, the world would be less hectic and cleaner place to live.

First, Life without cars would make life much less hectic. In Vaunban,Germany there is an upscale community where there are no cars. People either walk, ride bikes or take the public tram. A servey shows ""70 precent of Vanuban's families do not own cars, and 57 precent sold a car to move here"". People move to Vauban to enjoy a ""car-free""...stress free life. ""Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (sorce 1 paragrah 3) The ""car-free"" world of not having to worry about car payemrnt, incerance, and gas money is a whole lot better than a car dependent world.

Second, Limiting our car use would help make this planet cleaner. Pollution issues have gotten so bad that ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". (Source 2 paragraph 10) In paragraph 14 it states that ""after five-days of intensive smog...the smog rivaled Beijing,China, which is one one of the most polluted cities in the world"". France uses more diesel than gasoline, therefore making up 67 precent of all vehicles in France. The use of these harsh fossil feuls is a huge problem that can help be controlled by limiting our use of automobiles.

Third, Although some may argue that we need cars to fuction in our modern world, there are other options that we can choose. For example, If everyone took public transportation such as the subway we would be cutting back tremenously on the amout of feul consumed. Another advantage of using other forms of transportation other than a car would be that you wouldnt have to worry about your car not starting, or not having enough money too fill your tank. Other forms of transportation would always be reliable and convenent. You would also feel good about helping the enviornment by not adding extra gases to the ozone.

To finish up, Limiting our use of cars would make life easier and cleaner. In source 3 it states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Many people are convinved that a ""car-free"" life would be much nicer than the hectic car-consumed life we've all grown so accustom too. Limiting our use of cars is a good idea for our stressful lives.    ",4

First off, you can help people in need. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you help people that just came out of war, so they need help to get back on their feet. When you get there can be assigned a person you can help and hel them. The person your helping can be very nice, you might even become friends with them. Besides, they fought for your country, at lease helping them would be nice.

Secondly, you can visit many places you haven't seen. Have you ever wanted to go some where but didn't have the time to, well becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you can. For example, when I was helping people I got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also, visited Venice, Italy on my to China. One more place I visited was Panama Canal also on my way to China. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy gives you the once in a life time opportunity to see and go places where you might never get to go again.

Last but not least, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you can have a varity of things to do. When I was on the boat I was assigned to help my aunt Katie on her farm.

02dabc0,"Do you think theres a real alien artifact on mars? Well if you do, im sorry but there isn't. Even thoe ""the Face on Mars"" may look like an alien artifact, is just a natural land form. There are many of these in Cydonia and they're called Martian mesas. This Martian messa looks as if it's a face because of its unusual shadows that creat the illusion of eyes, a nose and a mouth.

In April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michale Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture, that is 10 times sharper than the orignal one tooken by Viking 1, of the face on mars. This picture finally revield that there was no face on mars, but a natural landform.

This didn't satisfi many people. They thought the alien markings where hidden by a haze, since that was the time of year where that part of mars gets clody. So on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor took a final look. Then, when they finally found it Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

What this thing actually is is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" which are landforms common around the American West. This was simply a chance for NASA to get a little money.                                      ",2

All he cares about is Seagoing Cowboys he want to be one. Well maybe if he is one then he might actullay be happy. He wants to be a Seagoing Cowboy he wants to be a good person thats all he wants in his life. He likes to watch the seagoing Cowboys and he like to hear it he might want to be a helper.

Luke he is a good person he likes the Seagoing Cowboys which is nothing bad at all he likes what he likes so that what he does.

02f131c,"This face on mars? Not exactly a sign of aleins. We can prove it. How you might ask? Well its simple if it were made by inteligent creaters would it probably still be ther. Well yes it would. Unless it were like a carnival and it travled around. But it was a giant rock. In this paper im going to prove to you that this face was not made by ""aliens"".

Twenty five years ago we found what looked like a face on mars. We didnt know if this were something caused by aliens or just something that was natural. Well that was untill we came back to take more pictures of this so called ""face"". We came back around twenty two years later. Just to find out we caught the face at the right time when we took the first picture. We found out the picture was takin in winter on the planet and it was a cloudy day.

But it has to be alein life form that created this. They can easely destroy what they make. us humans do it all the time. And why would you guys at NASA put something like this out in the world for people to see? If it wasnt real life on anouther planet. Do you like playing games with us.

So we also know that there is no life on mars because we have cameras that can capture the smallest of sheds. On camera so if we saw a little house on the camera we would think there is life on this plante for sure(11). at NASA we didnt know exactly what caused that face at the time. We realeased it so we could sow you guys we may have found something. Now we have proven that we didnt find anything. We can also tell you the ""Aliens"" didnt destroy anything because this rock is still there.

This artilcle was givin to you to prove that aliens didnt cause this ""face"". We know that there are no aliens on mars. Here in 2016 we have rovers up on mars we know nothing is up there. I was using the article to prove my theroy up above. and how could you think that a giant face is caused by aliens? People. I dont know what goes through there mind sometimes. So Thank you for reading and have a nice day.

02f14c6,"The face is just a natrual landform. In the article it says that NASA'S Viking 1spacecraft was just circleing around the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption notedd a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The aunthors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

The so called 'Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASSA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Although few sientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Plant in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the viking missions ended. And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars

Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Iidaho,"" says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heeight as the Face on Mars."" With this imformation you can include that the monument was just a landform, not anything mind blowing.",4
02f6c8a,"Since the time of its discovery, the ""Face on Mars"" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counter-arguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.

Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the ""fiction"" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.

The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counter-argument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counter-argument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the ""Face on Mars"" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution. ",5
302537,"I am for the development of driverless cars. I think it would be cool if we had cars that did the work for us. They are just like smart phones in a way. However I don't think we should completely have no control over the car. People may start thinking that they can do whatever while the driving is in progress. That is not the case. Drivers should still pay attention to the road as if they were normally driving. Driverless cars will benefit us in a positive way.

One reason why i am for driverless cars is for the disabled people who can't drive like others can. Those people deserve a way to get around town too. Another reason why i think having driverless cars is a good idea is because of the simple fact that it is an option. People can buy a driverless car but still take over if they want to or need too. Another good reason for having driverless cars is for long distance drives. Sometimes flying a plane to a far destination is too expensive but if a car could take people long distance to where they need to go without themselves having to drive such a long way it would be more easier for themselves. The only concern with driverless car would be ""Who is at fault"" but that could be easily depicted i'm sure.

Driverless cars would benefit us greatly. It shows no harm to anybody who would like to have no driver. For all the reasons previously stated it is a good idea to have driverless cars. After all, it is our decision to make whether or not we want to have driverless cars. ",3

The sensors could go bad while your driving it some were and it breaks down on you. Wouldnt drivers get borewd waiting for there turn to drive?

If the driverless car comes out, what kind of different laws will be made for the car? What will the top speed be for the driverless cars? How much would it cost to replace the sensors? How will the car kno where to take you to your destination? How long will the car last be in driverless mode? Will it be operated off gas or electricity?",1
0307ec7,"The electoral college may seem like its a good idea to keep thngs going,but I think America should get rid of it. Alote of people say its unfair. Mostly because of the winner-take-all system. If you were to vote for a presedent, you are in favor, everyone would like thier vote to be counted,right? and it is,but is it really counted towards the presedent we want to get voted for elections?

According to this article, you dont really vote for the presedent you want, what you are really voting on is a state of elector, and if he gets elected he is the one who really gets to vote for the precedent. And that is unfair, I think we should change it to popular vote. We should change it to polular vote because the elecoral college is really unfair to Americas citizens. Also alote of people argue about the winner takes all system because candidates dont spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. Also it is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

Like I said it is unfair, outdated, and irrational,with all these things I dont think many people would like that .So I think we should change it to popular vote, i think it would be easyier and it would be more fair,and that is what our citizens want. And that is what we should give them. After all its thier vote that counts, so lets let them decide if we should keep it the same with the electoral college or change it to some way better like by popular vote.

so according to all this information I think we should change our way of voting and flip everything around to something fair and effective. We need somthing that would make our vote count. somthing that would be fair to all of our citizens. after all its what we choose then thats what we ned to be happening. only you can prevent unfairness.

Even thought alien are real the face that the scientists descrided was like a human face, ""Which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""(Paragraph 3). By the look of the face it already gives us a lot of information that it's a human face.

It also said that it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh on paragraph 2, ""Only this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"". Almost every evidence showed that it was formed in a human face. Even thought some scientistic belived that the face was an alien artifact they can't prove it.

030cf8b,"In as small of a community as the Florida Keys, it is harder than it seems to unify us. yes we have sandbar sunday and woofstock but what else could we do on a daily basis that could unit us? As a community, if we were to limit car usage it would unit the community, decrease polution, and decrease the ammount of stress oon people. Making our community better is just one small step to making the world a better place.

Living in the keys, we all know that when the snowbirds come down traffic builds up to where it is not even moving. If we were to limit the car usage and say that on Mondays, Wensdays, and Fridays you had to either car pool or use public transportation it would unit us as a community. According to Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times Company,this year in Bogota, Colombia the city of 7 million went a day with out cars to promote alternative transportation(Selsky, paragraph20). Selsky also taked about how two other cities joined in, Cali and Valledupar,and how they helped generate a revolutionary change(25-26).Also according to Elisabeth Ronsenthal, a New York Times writer,"" ...The Internet makes telecomuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet forends""(Ronsenthal, paragraph 35).This just goes to show that no matter how big or little your community is, a day without cars might just be what you need to unify your community.

Along with beautiful clear waters, we also have our share of polution lingering in our mangroves and in our bay. Polution can be anything from a peice of garbage to smog in our air that is slowly suffocating our native plants. Even though down here we dont have a lot of smog, we still have to be awear of it and what it is doing to our neighboring communities. According to Elisabeth Ronsenthal,from the New York Times, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States""(Ronsenthal, paragraph 5). Also according to Robert Duffer,from the Chicago Tribune,""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city""(Duffer, Paragraph 10). If we want to keep our beautiful water clean we should consider going to a limited car use schedual.

Lastly, by chosing to inforce a limited car use day it would decrease the stress in our community making it even more like paradise. According to Andrew selsky,""'It's a dood opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife(Selsky, paragraph 24). Also other sientist have proven that daily excersise can reduce stress levels caused when a hormone is relised while you excersise.

In conclusion, by reducing or limitincar use for a day you can unify your community, help decrease polution, and decrease your stress levels.             ",3
318358,"Driverless cars would be cool, but they're not safe enough to have around. The drivers have nothing to do, the driverless feature in the car could get messed up, or even the things that alert the driver that it's their turn to drive. There are so many dangers to having driverless cars, this is just a few.

For example when all the driver has to do is sit there, it will be takenadvantage of. People could fall asleep at the wheel and not be able to take over the driving when they're needed to. A lot more messing around would occur so the driver would not be focusing. Drivers need to stay focused on the road so everyone can safely arrive to their destination.

Never know when the driverless feature could have a glitch or break down. Cars break down all the time, what's any different about the cars systems? Nothing, these cars could have been manufactured incorrectly. The GPS could also stop working or hit a glitch and you could end up 20 miles away from where you want or need to be.

Imagine. You're in your driverless car, somethings coming up that you need to take over for, but you're just talking away and having a big jam session with all your friends. Your car means to alert you but the system is broken, the car keeps moving but it thinks you're driving, you hit a construction worker. Now you have a huge fine to pay plus you have to get your car fixed.

With these new driverless cars their drivers aren't going to be paying enough attention, your car glitches out, or you're to busy having a jam session with your friends. So many things could go wrong. These cars would be teaching the youth they don't need to pay attention, the car will do it for them. All in all driverless cars are not safe and should not be developed.",3
03194a0,"This face has been the talk of NASA and the talk of headlines for quite sometime. The topic has been argued many times and there are many different opinions on whether or not its a face or a natural landform. What do you think?

The discussions of this being a face are all over the place, poeple believe that ailens have caused this ""face"" on Mars surface. There are three different pictures, one from 1976, one from 1998, and one from 2001. In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face. There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago. In the article it says that the camera that was used to capture the 1976 photo only had 43 meters per pixel, in other words meaning that there's almost no way in telling what the first picture was or resembled.

In 1998 and 2001, you can see the picture more clearly due to the advancement in technology you clean clearly see that there is no outline or resembalance of a face. The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa. In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud. When the photographs began to be released online there was many observations but many realized it was infacr not a face.

After all the questions blew over, Directors began putting images and shots into movies which again started raising talk. In movies or films there are special effects people that are able to enchance photos and clips. So most of the photographs and clips are not actually NASA recorded and theres a good chance most of them had been edited to make more money on a film or movie because people want to know more about myterious things like this.

Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa. Science it to greatly advanced now and if there was any form of life on any other planets NASA would atleast have an idea of it. I don't believe this is an alien artifact, because Mars cannot support life.          ",4
031ab01,"If we had a facial action coding system in every classroom, Would the students have a higher chance of suceeding? Would they get more or less help? Would this gather more attention in class? I would think so. I mostly agree with having a facial Action Coding system in classrooms to tell how the students are feeling. I disagree with some aswell. If the teachers could tell exactly how each student is feeling in class, like bored or confused, I think that they would provide more help to those students, and there will be a higher percentage of people who pass there clases. In the passage making Mona Lisa Smile, they used the technology on the painting of Mona Lisa. I think that if they used it on the students, they would be more engaged and ready to learn.

I think that the students would find more things being taught to them in class interesting. In the passage it has an example that I think would be good for the use of this software to be in schools. ""For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If this were to happen, I know that I would do a lot better. I feel that many other students would do better too. When we get an ad that we like, and similar ads pop up, usually they are watched. If we were in class and we felt happy, or not happy with what we are learning, The teaching style or lesson might change to something that will keep more students engaged. But I feel like their are other things that aren't so good about the software.

If the softwared was installed in every class and you walked in feeling very upset for something that maybe happened outside of class or school, you will most likely feel that way the whole time during that class. The machine might pick that up as if you are not being interested in the topic. You wouldn't get anywhere. Now if you tell the teacher that you aren't happy for whatever reason, thats a different story. But, if you're shy and you don't tell people how you feel especially if something happened to make you feel sad, angry, etc... I don't think the machine would help to much in terms of education. But if you are more engaged in learning because of the software, I think their will be a way higher chance for more people to graduate.

If you are engaged, interested, or into whatever you're learning, You will most likely be paying attention and taking in the information. If you were in class, and the software picks up that you understand whats being taught, more people would focus in that class. If this happens, more people would pass tests, exams, and graduate. After you graduate, you will have learned all the education that you needed to learn to go to college. Sence more people have the education, more people would go to college.

If we had the facial action coding system software in classrooms I think that more people would have a higher chance of succeeding, getting help, paying attention, passing tests and exams. I also think that more people will go to college. I think that more people would pay attention, be interested in what they're learning, and I think it would be easier to more students. If the software were to mess up, I think that the teachers would have more problems to deal with like getting it fixed, or just simply teach without it. If their are no problems with it, I think that this would be a very helpful tool for teachers and students.",4
031bbb0,"Do you think this ""face"" was created by aliens? I think not because this ""face"" was not created by aliens but created by a natural landform. Landforms happen all the time, just because it happend on another planet doesn't mean aliens did it.

In the article NASA unveiled the picture for all to see and THEY captioned it ""huge rock formation"" . Which basicly means even NASA doen't think it was aliens who created it. Also after the articles states what NASA captioned the picture, it says ""formed by shadows giving the ALLUSION of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Its just an allusion not even a face really.

Also, the aticle says ""there was no alien monument arter all."" if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world. I'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. NASA probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. Skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. Come on really, all the great technology NASA has and you think it was hidden behind clouds.

The technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. Marvin, from NASA says it reminded him of landforms created on Earth, so if an expert that works at NASA

thinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it?

3.205E+12,"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It is the second planet from the Sun. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about the dangers of exploring Venus. The author describes the temperature of Venus, the danger of its light, and the overall danger. Besides explains what Venus, a planet and not a star, looks like, the author also states that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""Twin"". Both planets are close in size and density. One difference is that Venus is over 200 times hotter in temperature than Earth is. The average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees in Fahrenheit. That is hotter than Earth will ever be. In In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such as environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author also states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury in closer to the sun."" In that example from the story, the author is trying to explain that Venus is so hot that it would melt anything in less then a minute.

Besides being so hot, Venus is also very bright. Venus's light is brighter than our eyes could ever see. It is so bright on Venus that not even researches can take a photo or a video of the planet. This must mean that research have to keep their distance. If they get close, they will have the risk of becoming blind or dying from the hot temperature. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" The author also states, ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" The auther is trying to explain that since researchers have to keep their distance, they can't take a sample with them to Earth. Samples from Venus would help them gain knowledge of Venus.

Venus has many dangers and risks of exploring the planet. Researches can't go to the planet because it is so hot and the light is very bright. Their machines keep melting from the hot temperature. The author in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains the dangers but the author also states, ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" ",4

Because of the amounts of pollution there was Paris inforced a partial driving ban in attempt to clear the air of the global city, there was a 22 fine($31). In Paris, close to 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 cars were impounded for over reacting to the fine.

I think more countries should participate in this event, just because you are limiting yourself to how much you use your car and it seems like it would be alot of fun and is honestly such a great opportunity for you and everyone around you trying to make a diffrence.

""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses"". This is actually very surprising knowing that America is and has been one of the world's prime car cultures. ""They are not interested"", Said a mom of two children that are 19 and 21. She said, ""even though they both live in places where one could come in handy....but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take a public transportation or car-pool with friends."" To me I think these adults are making a statment. That you do not always have to have a car, and you most definatly do not have to have a licence to get you places. These teenagers are saving their money not having to worry about gas prices and car payments. Instead they are not wasting their money by walking and car-pooling to their jobs. It might take some time walking but you still get there.

In conclucion, I feel like getting to places with cars is fast, and I know most people agree with me...but why not just once in a couple of days just drop your keys and ride your bike or walk to work. Limit how much you use your car. I promise you you will see a difference in your life.             ",3
0329d02,"I am against driverless cars because I think the electrical components and computer software are more likely to fail than a human driver. The idea of a driverless or smart car was actually a really dumb idea if the smart car was really 'smart' then it could navigate its way through roadwork but people just keep getting lazier and lazier their always looking for much easier ways of doing stuff, my personal opinion is that we need to go back to making vehicles like we did in the 1970s they were simple, easy to fix, and were real nice looking vehicles. The human drivers of a driverless car can easily be distracted by all this technology the car manufacturers have put in and on these vehicles that they could be driving and end up in a fatal crash just because they was distracted by some 3-D lazer mapping or a camera on the inside of the car.

These kind of cars would change the world but people would regret it later on in the years when more and more people get killed because of them. If it ever happens I do not care what people say or do I am still going to have a completly human driven vehicle i would not buy one of those junk driverless ones. ",2
032a3bf,"""Here we go again, sirens."" ""How many accidents is that now, three in less than a week?"" Car accidents are increasing by the minute as decades pass. Drivers are losing their lives each and everyday, familes are greiving over loses, friends, siblings, relatives are being lost due to drunk drivers and young teens just now starting to drive. The air pollution is also getting worse because of vehicles that are used everyday to get from point A to point B, gas prices are rising and sometimes you cant even get to places sometimes because theres so much traffic in the street! We can prevent many of these problems by simply limiting the use of time people spend driving .

U.S. citizens should have a right in the dispute people are having over this topic. Should the U.S. limit the use of vehicles being used everyday? Yes. Millions of dollars are wasted everyday for people need gas in their vehicles to get to where they're going. Money that could be used to feed their familes or money that also can be used to buy clothes and other necessary things. There are Amercian citizens that live on the streets or in alleys that are in desperate need of clothes, food or even a home & here we are spending it on something that can be replaced by something as simple as walking or riding a bike to where you need to go.

Every year there are more and more car accidents being reported and the number keeps increasing. Teens that are in highschool and are just now driving on the roads are one of the top main causes on car accidents, another main cause of accidents are drunk drivers. Americans like to go to parties or gatherings or even just bonfires with friends sometimes and they drink recklessly. Then when time comes for them to leave, they get in their cars intoxicated, driving to wherever they need to go and boom! Their reactions just werent quick enough or they werent paying as much attention as they would driving sober and they crash into anything that came their way. Injuries were made, a life or maybe more than one was lost all because of a mistake that was made earlier that day.

Another reason why cars should be limited is air pollution. If cars are needed to be used on and everyday basis they should make them more ""enviornmentally friendly"". Some gases in gasoline are toxic and/or flamable. Gasoline can drip on something without you knowing and the tinest spark could ignite something so simple, that could turn into a burning fire. Your belongings could be burned to ashes or your car could even blow up into flames. Then money is needed to repair the damage or valuables that couldnt be replaced could be gone. The burning of everything could also release toxins into the air and cause sicknesses in some or could damage our ozone layer more then it already is.

Im not saying people should be banned from every using vehicles again, but it would help greatly if the usage is limited up to a certain point or instead of destroying, it could be used to benefit our enviornment; even leave it neutral.

Americans need to understand that there is more to life then sitting and letting things happen for you. Go for walks, take hikes, rollerblade, plan a bike ride through the park with the family, theres more to life than cars and vehicles. Sure its nice to go somewhere without having to walk but sometimes its good to have family outings and its also refreshing and fullfilling to feel the crisp, cold air hit your skin, walking outside the house on a cold day.

032db9e,"A relevant topic in today's society that many people often discuss is the reduction of motor vehicle use. Limited use of vehicles such as cars, buses, and trucks can have great effects on the environment. Most of the effects are beneficial to the environment such as the reduction of smog which can ameliorate the horrible impact we have already had on the environment.

According to source 1, limited use of of motor vehicles will be less harmful to the environment. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when you factor in the gas emission from the United States which is more than four times what it is in Europe. Source 1 also claims that less use of motor vehicles will lower people's stress and will make children more social because they will be able to play near the streets without having to worry about being hit by a car.

All of these sources claim that motor vehicle reduction will also reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions. One source that supports this claim is source 2, not only does Paris emit more greenhouse gases than any other city in Europe, they now have two days in which people who drive their cars are subject to a 22 euro (31 U.S. dollar) fine.

Bogota, Colombia is proving to be the most successful in attempting to lower greenhouse gas emission. According to source 3 car-free day has been started in which citizens may not drive their vehicles without being subject to a twenty-five dollar fine. Most citizens obey this law and the amount of traffic jams is reduced to empty streets other than public buses. The increase in amount of people riding their bikes caused sidewalks to be repaired and replaced which improves the aesthetics of the city. Several small restaurants and various other businesses saw an increased income. Along with sources 1 and 2, source 3 claims that citizens are less stressed when not driving a motor vehicle. Along with this statement. source 3 also claims that people will begin to be more socially active when they are carpooled to school and other places.

Source 4 takes place not in Europe, not in South America, but in our own country, the United States of America. In the last few years, the United States has seen a decrease in the amount of people driving motor vehicles. We have not, however seen a decrease on our impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. This is because though people are driving less, many people in this country drive large, gas guzzling Hummers and trucks which emit more gases than any other vehicle. If people stopped driving those vehicles, we would definately see a decrease in greenhouse gases. We've seen it happen in Europe because large personal transport trucks are seldom driven in Europe.

Many advantages will be seen when the act of driving a motor vehicle becomes rarer. These advantages include our emission of greenhouse gases, improved social interactions, people who are less stressed, and an overall more cheerful environment. Multiple sources make these claims, and many countries in Europe such as France and countries in South America have placed certain days in which citizens don't drive cars. These days have proven many of these claims that support the assertion that there are multiple advantages to limited car usage.                                ",4
03314fd,"After reading this article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I believe that being able to detect and know how to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and could be useful for many. Using technology to know whether an individual is upset, happy, mad, etc. could be used as an improvement on our daily lives. According to the article, they tested this new technology on the famous Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting and defined that ""she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The outcomes from this new technology system could actually be legit and can tell us what people feel. This new sofware can also help the people that are to afriad to express their feelings or don't know how to .

Sense there are some individuals who hid their feelings and aren't that easy to read their emotions by just looking at their facial expressions, by using this system you could read and even track their face movments and even their mixed emotions also. For instance, as stated in the passage ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"".""Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This new software can help those who have a ""neutral face"" and show no emotion.

Facial expressions aren't always going to reveal how an individual is actually feeling or what emotions he is going through inside. For example, in the article it indicates that the Mona Lisa is ""9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", even though in the painting she looks 100 percent happy. This software will read off your emotions no matter what face expression you are making. Many of us can use this software to figure out what others are feeling when they are to scared to tell others how they feel. For instance, if someone is feeling really upset and has a neutral face and you can't tell that they are upset, you can't help them unless you know how they are feeling.

In conculsion, I believe that This new software ""Facial Action Coding"" that helps reveal human emotions by using technology cn be valuable and useful for certain people.",3
0331f55,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future, or are they? The Article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨ allows us to believe that maybe thery´re not a thing of the future, but actually a right now present day modification to our way of living.. Now is this a good thing regarding the safety of the common people, I believe so. Does it help or economy, lets discuss and see.

First off the article points out that google has been doing thier test runs since 2009. ¨Their cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.¨ No one has been killed in these test runs, and how many have been killed in regular driving since 2009, the number is sad. Driving these cars arent as dangerous as people make them out to be. I would also like ot point out that these cars may be able to dive themselve's, but Google cars arent entirely driverless. They're unable to back out , and navigate through roadworks and accident, so they allert the driver in those situations. The car knows when its unsafe for it to be the one in control of driving so, its going to alert you to take over and get through this. Some of the ways engineers have allowed this is with vibrating seats, and flashing lights in the car. Some have even suggested getting a camera installed inside the car, that way the car knows if your paying attention while you are driving. Next these cars are not made so people can daze off, and text on their phones, or just not do anything in the car. Special sensors in the sterring wheel allow the car to know if you have your hands on the wheel. The cars are designed so that the driver must stay alert while drivig, and ready to jump in when roads require human skills. With all of these necessary precautions in store, and the history of how well Google has managed so far, it´s very safe for the right driver to be behind the wheel of one of these cars.

Its the best option we have economically wise, of changing the world, and advancing the world. Smart roads were investigated, in the 1950's general motors created a consept car that could run on a special test track embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever at the front end of a car. Again Berkley tried the same thing using magnets and alternating polarity. The smart roads worked very well, but the cost of upgrading all of our roads to fit the criteria was to much of a hit to the economy, the smartest choice was to modify cars so that they could become smart enough to be dirverless. To be safe the cars have a lot of sensors installed into them. The most important sensor having to be LIDAR on the roof of the car. This sensor shootss out a laser beam to form a constantly 3-D model of the cars surroundings. To help the economy its safer to update the cars with these, then to fully update the road systems we have now.

Driverless cars are not a thing of the future, ther're a present day modification to our way of living. They're not anymore dangerous then driving a normal car, and may even be a bit safer. Also they're the best choice econoimcally that our country can provide, to improve our way of living and advance us that much further. So why not get with the new era and drive a driverless car.                                                                                                                    ",4

Another pro about Driverless cars is that it will most likely fundementally change the world as we know it because if the manufactuers develop Driverless cars then you won't see pedestrians using the bus, train, or the regular automotive vehicle.

According to the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", there are also many con's or negative conotations concerning Driverless Cars.

Another ""con"" or negative connotation about Driverless Cars is that the Driverless car is not fully safe.

033aa4b,"Venus is a planet in space, that is the second planet from the sun and the closest plant to Earth density and size wise.

Other dangerous conditions are such as the temperatures that ""average 800 degrees Fahrenheit.""

The author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. It is a worthy pursuit because researchers can explore new types of rocks, gas, and etc. Because Venus is such as harsh planet, it makes everything on the planet that much rare. Despite the conditions, when things on the planet are discovered it can make a huge impact on the history of space and scientists.

The second reason why it´s a good reason to explore Venus it because of the future. If NASA finds a way to explore Venus (because of the extremely harsh weather condition) then we could possibly explore other planets in the soloar system without being worried of other weather relate obstacles.

Even though exploring Venus will take a long time, it will worth waiting. If NASA explores Venus and goes succesfully, then it could cause a scientific break through, leading science into a new world of innovation, new technology, and a more sophisicated world.

345980,"Driverless cars are going to be amazing when they are released to the public.

They are very intelligent machines that can make better or faster decisions than humans can on the road. Even though they are just testing them now, they still haven't caused any accidents. Think about it, everyone who drives a driverless car will have the option to steer, so it's their choice whether their life is at risk.

Driverless cars haven't caused car-on-car accidents. The text states that driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. There have been a few cases where the driverless cars were involved in accidents, but that was because other people wrecked into them. They usually don't make road errors, but other people mess them up because of their bad driving habits.

Drivers still have the option to take the wheel if they feel, or if the car feels, like

something is wrong. The text states that driverless cars require some human skill so they would have to take the wheel at some point, but the rest of the driving is optional. The text also states that the driverless cars are also being programmed to warn the driver when they need to take control. The only drawback to this is that drivers will still have to be alert at all times incase the car needs their help.

It may take some time before they are fully safe. The text states that there are some situations where humans would have to take control of the car like pulling out of driveways or moving around construction zones. This implies that the cars can't deal with humans very well. They can still manage to get in accidents with pedestrians if those people aren't dong what they are supposed to like J-walking. It will take awhile before driverless cars are upgraded with more reliable sensors that can detect pedestrians and even animals too.

Driverless cars are going to be a huge innovation that changes the way everyone travels. Driverless cars are safe, fast decision makers, and help people get from place to place without driving the whole time. I wouldn't turn down a trip in something that has all of those great qualities. Driverless cars will truely be amazing when they are released.",4

They don't know if they actually seen a face they said it was winter on that side when this picture was tooken. So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras when they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but i would see why you would think that. It is kind of weird to see other things like this on other planets that don't even have human life or something close to it for this to happen.

035e3c7,"Dear state senator,

As a law abiding citizen, I feel that the American public should have a say-so in the elections of the President, or any other government party leader, and to do so, should be a direct vote. While our Founding Fathers, with all due respect, chose the Electoral College to pick and choose our leaders, this is the 21st centuary. A centuary in which the government upholds too much power.

The government has been critized quite intensely over the last few years over one topic - lying. Lying to the citizens in which it - should - be serving. Although, it doesn't. The government serves itself. So why should we elect a panel of people to elect for us? After all, when we vote, we - I speak for the entire American republic here - imagine us submitting our vote to count directly for our selected representative. Not for some unknown nit-wit to chose a government agent for us. What if said nit-wit lies, miscounts, or purposely puts his own imput into the system instead of the American voting population?

Direct voting is, perhaps, inevitably more efficient. Our votes could run through a machine, much like a state test such as FCAT, anf the total vote could be directed for either candidate. The chances of a tied poll is rather extremely unlikely due to the masses of the American republic. Plus, it singles out the chance of lying in a government of liars.

Swing states wouldn't exist. Instead of singling out a particular area of the country, they'd be, more so, targeting the country as a whole, because then would every individual vote mattered. No one would be left out, and the more honest, obviously more chosen, president would win out, and almost everyone would be happy.

We live in a system at which the government lies, quite fairly, a lot. A direct vote would whip them out of that in the voting process, as the votes, singularly, would matter. Every last one of them. It would also nip the idea that only certain areas, certain states, mattered, because again, every vote would matter. Directing voting is obviously the way to go.

Signed,

Law Abiding Citizen.    ",3
035e589,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise.

In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens.

It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally.

The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them.

Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more.               ",4

It would not make sense that a face would be on Mars. I belive it is just a landform because it looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Globel Surveyor flow over Cydonia and took a picture and it was a natural landform. The pectures this time were ten times sharper then the ones from the original Viving picture. There was no alien monument after all. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.

On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, caompared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. With this images if there are any objects there you are going to see it.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These landforms are common to the ones in the American West. They remind us most of the Middle Burre in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

I know that the second picture was taken on a cloudy day and it was not all clear. The origanal picure did have a differnt shadow also. There was however, a third picture taken and that was on a clear day and it showed that it was just a lanform. The origanal picture only had 43 meters compared to the one in 2001 that had 1.56 meters.

In counclusion the face on Mars was just a moon. There were two pictures taken after the origanal picture and they both show that in is just landforms. I belive it is just a landform because it looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.     ",3
03630c7,"Have you ever heard of the Seagoing Cowboys program?

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a thing alot of people should do. We help out with alot of stuff such as animals, and problems that where hard to solve after World War 2. You could also see amazing sights. I'm going to tell you all about the Seagoing Cowboys program.

In 1945 we had to help with horses in New Orleans. We had to make sure they had enough hay and oats to be fed with. Although there was 335 horses to feed we still helped out. For instance we crossed the alantic ocean for 2 weeks, just to get to China to help out. First,We fed them, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower parts of the ship. Then all the stalls had to be cleaned.

If you joined this program you would get to see amazing sights. Its a once in a lifetime chance to travel to China, Europe, Venice,and Italy. I got to explore the castel in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There is so many sights to be marveled at or explored. You should try this out.

There is so much more than helping animals and seeing amazing monuments and sights. You would also get to help people. There are lots of people out there who dont have much food or any shelter. World War 2 is the cause of this harm to people. First of all, helping people could give you a good reputation. Secondly, its nice to help people who are poor and don't have shelter or food. Lastly, I think it is a good thing to do for those people.

People fought in World War 2 and now its your turn to step up and lend a helping hand. This program is possibly the most helpfullest program in the U.S.A.                    ",3

The Electoral College is a very organized way of handling the Presidential election. It makes certain that tthere is usually a landslide victory. The locations of the states help the canidates and the Electoral Colloege states that you have to have transregional appeal.

The swing states such as Florida, are the states presidental canidates pay attention to. The votes there are the ones thats can decide the election. The lager states, due to there large population, also get more Electoral votes.

The Electoral Colloege has helped avioded run-off elections by reducing the complication of it all. The Electoral College is made up of five-hundred thirty-eight electors and all that is need to elect a president is two-hundred seventy electoral votes. The electoral College is the easier and less complicated way of electing a president.

Though whether the Electoral College is democratic, it is not true in a modern sense. It is still very practical and less complicated. The people instead would vote for slates of electors but, they still would be voting towards you canidate. The Electoral College is the method that we should keep.    ",2
036e19b,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.",2
036f820,"Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages. Even though there are many reasons, a big topic would be because of the gas getting in the air creating ""smog"" or pollution. Keeping the earth clean but banning cars can make the enviornment a better place.

To being with, limiting the use of cars can be very good for our enviornment because it would make the air less polluted. As stated in source 2 paragraph 5,""congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" thats a big percent and with that we are making the earth green. France even tried to ban cars even and odd to reduce the pollution as being talked about in paragraph 2 and 3. They were being fined if they drove, that is atleast until the air cleared up.

On the other hand, banning cars or not driving is a silly decision. It may be good for our earth and our health, but if you need to leave three hours before hand to reach your destination on time, then you need to buckle up and step on the gas. If gas so so bad for the enviornment, then why dont we ban gas cars? There are many indrustries and or companys that have created electronic cars. Charging our cars many be difficlut for long road trips but there could be a slot for gas for when our battery level is running low we can get some gas to reach a destination and charge it.

Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages, but also a few disadvanteages. Cars can clean up the air but also make us gasp for it. Having a car should be a choice we get to make. Having events and days where ""no cars can be driven or you get a fine"" is not needed in anybodys lives. What decision would you decide, having a car, or joining in on being green?            ",3
03705ca,"To my fellow citizens all across the world I think there are a lot of advantages that come with the limited car usage. One thing is that it could save the environment from the polution of gas. Also it could save people a whole lot of money if they didn't have a car. Lastly and final statement why limited car usage is advantage is that they use the money from the car to buy homes.

For starters, their are a lot of things that come with buying a car but a lot of people dont no is that every time they start up there car their actually hurting the evironment because of the gas. Here is an example from source 2.""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". After reading that it seems to me that the pollution of the gas is becoming to be a problem all around the world and thats why we need to put a stop to it by just banning it for country to country and then eventually become a car free world. Another example I found from source 2. ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". I read that and i was like wow! I wonder why that might be well if they banned the car usage they might bring do there pollution or congestion in the city. Thats why the pollution from the gas is so bad it could actually harm or maybe possibly kill them if they breathe in that pollution on a consistant basis.

Secondly, people make pretty big sacrifices in life but one I found most interesting was that Germany residents were selling there cars to buy homes for them to live in. This strikes my eye in very many ways is that they are saving an expense they don't need and also saving the environment also. For example, in source 1 it said ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". I find that quite interesting why a family like that would just give up transportation and then I thought well they save a ton of money and also they get to move to maybe a better living environment just by limiting the car usage. People who live in Levittown, New York are good example of limited car usage because a lot of them work in the city and a lot of times driving into the city is not a very good thing to do because of the traffic. So what do they do? They don't drive a car but only to the train station were they ride the train to and from the city saving money in gas and its easier to do it that way.

Thirdly, citizens use limited car usage to save money in life because lets all face it the world we live in is tough money is hard to come by and people have car payments they have to pay every month and sometimes they cant make that payment cause they have other bills they have to pay so what do they do. They sell they car and that gives them extra money a month to pay for bills a such forth. Another thing they save from selling there car is that they don't have to pay for gas either so your probably saving some where around 200 hundred dollars in cash or credit in one month which is good. Thats another reason why selling your car is an advantage of limited car usage.

In conclusion, their are a lot of ways where citizens of the world can use limiting there car usage as an advantage. Where it might be saving the environment or selling your vehicle to buy a home or even maybe just to save money in everyday life like some citizens do in Levittown, New York. These were some of my opinions on advantages of limiting car usage in everyday life.                ",4
0374dae,"On may 24,2001 NASA Viking was snapping pictures around mars when something weird showed up on one of the photos. when NASA seen what looked like a human face went crazy. An ever since NASA'S crazy image got out thousends and thousends of people all around america were talking about ""the face on mars"". But Mars Orbiter Camera team came to find that it was not a human face but just a simple natural landform.

Many people believed that it was an alien artifact. Even few sciantists believed this too. But on April 5, 1998, Mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the frist time .Mas Orbiter team took a picture ten times sharper then viking photo. When the picture was taken by Mars camera team showed upon a JPL web site. Showing that the image was a natural landform, that there was no alien atifact. People still don't believe that it's just a natural landform, but this picture was taken by a digital image 3 times bigger then pixel size. so if any other objects such as airplanes, egyptial shaped pyramids, or small shacks you would most definetly see them. The landform that is actually shown on mars was a commom landform around American West.

In conclusion you can see that this image was studied very hard on to find out was it actually was, wich is a natural landform found in the American West. An if you still don't believe just think about it. The image taken that reaveled it to be a natural landform had each pixel in the 2001 spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 Viking image.",3
037545d,"The world is filled different types of technology. Apple, a major technology industry, has invented multiple types of phones, computers, watches, and televisons. Computers have evolved within the last five years and the have made a whole new world. The use of technology to read students' emotional expression is valuable because it is able to detect if a student is confused and it can track emotional-recognition.

While in school, most students do not like raising their hand or asking any questions if they are lost during a lesson because they may feel embarrassed or scared. For example in paragraph six, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" He aslo predicts, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Furtherore, Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" With the classroom computer, students may feel more comfortable and more confident in themselves because they would have the ability to learn one-on-one with an instructor to get the help they need without feeling embarrassed. In addition, the computer with be able to track emotional-recognition.

Computers that have the ability to track emotions would benefit everyone. In paragraph five it states, ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vini studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles preciesly enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" Furthermore, in paragraph six it states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad with be different."" Emotional-recognition could improve how people are feeling and help them get through the day.

In contrast, a computer that can detect emotion could not work well with some people. In paragraph six it states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad."" Also, in paragraph two it states, ""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" People might not like the idea of their computer knowing how they are feeling because if the computer gives them false feedback, they might not agree with the new software. In addition, people might pay money for a software that does not give them the correct emotion or the software might not work in general.

The use of technology has definetly taken over the world. With the new computer software, it is able to read how each student is feelings and how it can track the emotions of everyday people. Applying emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise could change the face of technology. ",4
0376bcb,"Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.

The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.

Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.

It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.

This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars. ",3
037ac1f,"Driverless cars

The point that the article is making is that should we have cars that can drive themselfes, in my opinoin i would say no because it would cause so much disstortion and everthing would be in a heave of trouble. What we would be doing is we would be taking away jobs for people that live off of driving people places, or we would be spending so much money trying to make these cars, and also what would happen when the went out of control and no one could stop them then what would we do.

The idea of people losing jobs dosent sound right for me because i know how frustrating it is to lose many jobs and it isn´t easy. And something else what would stop those people who are mad and ticked at the idea that they just lost their jobs to a bunch of robots, that wont go so well because they will probably start rioting in the streets and that will just cause more of a problem´s for everone.

And also you would have to conceder on how much money they would have to spend to keep making those types of cars, it will probably cost millions of dollars for just one state. So they would be spending more money on making the cars than they would be getting so it seems that it would be a waste of time on what this idea has in store.

What other problems would happen if something went wrong with these cars like to say if someone missed up with the programming it could cause a lot of problems across the united states because so many car crashes would be happening, and that would bring so much panic through out the nation. so that is another reason why not to.

So what is the article stating is if we should have cars that control themselfs. there is to many if´s for me to say that we should like i can see that there are good parts to this like to say that we wouldn´t spend so much many on gas and it would be safer for the most part. But my answer is still no because we cant alwas y just think that since it is technology we are safe will that not alwas the case and we have to learn that. So no we shouldn´t have cars that drive themselves.",3

Two doctors think they have the power to do so, Proffesor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsredam and Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

I believe that the new advancment would be a wonderful idea. I believe that seeing somebody's when they are trying to hide them is gonna bring new thrills to life. Actually knowing someone's emotions could be beneficial for thing such as suicide maybe if we knew what somebody's emotions were we would be able to help somebody to make them feel happy. In the passage article for has a quote saying ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" I believe this is a good quote because it ties in with me saying that emotions could help people but having facial emotions would benefit as well because then we would not only physically see someone's emotion but we would be able to feel the happiness, pain,anger or etc.

So overall I think Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman could possibly have a amazing overall invention there are lots of positives for this invention. Such as having less suicides, or maybe if seeing someone happy could make someone else happy and could start a emotion train.

Driverless cars is a brilliant, genius idea. Having a driverless car helps better our environment, safety, and could even save you some extra money.

Pollution and global warming is a big problem. Our Earth is dying. With over population in many countries having cars that run on gas impacts our enviroment. All the fuel tha that is used is killing Earth day by day. Now, think about this. Having a car that runs on only half the fuel you would typically use? Sounds good right? Using only half the fuel we would typically use would make a tremendous differnece in our environment in a matter of a year.

Having a vehicle is a privlage. It can also be very dangerous. In the news we always here about that one person or that group of teenagers getting into a car with a driver under the influence. Then we know what happens next. When you are under the influence you do not know you are,therfore, you think you are fine to do anything especially driving. Having a driverless car may actually saves lives. If one is out drinking or doing things they should not be and decide they have to drive, that car might just save them from the unexpected.

Lastly, lets talk money. We all want to save money and buy more toys. Maybe you even want to go on a vacation to some nice beach where it is warm. How are you going to do that when you get a nice $1000 dollar spending ticket in a construction zone on I-65? Driverless vehicles maintain speed limit and know driving regulations. You may want to be going faster but your car is going to save you from getting that ticket.

Better environment, protection of human safety, and money saving is something all like to hear. This new driverless car is all that within one vehicle. Purchasing a car can be difficult. You want the best for you money. Having a car that helps the enviornment, protects you, and saves you money is the car you should be interested in. ",4
039e817,"Dear state senator,

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people. People should be able to vote for the president they want and not have electors elect the president. If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

The real question is, do you want your teacher to know if your happy, sad, mad, fustrated, confused, or board?

To some, the answer is simply yes, the ones who want others to know what ther are feeling are mostlikly a socil-type person.

On the other hand, its a simple no, if you know somone is gauging your emotions, say you didn't want anyone to know your mad, angery, or sad, would you be afraed to make any exprestion at all, or even go to class.

Nowadays, being watched is a normal acurance, but not to the personal level as to your emotions or thoughts.

Many may ask, what good is it to know about how one is feeling, the answer is unclear.

In paragraph six, the artical tells how helpfull FACS could be to the classroom, but if students should learn anything about real life, its crucial for them to understand, you can't please everyone, as much as you try, you won't.

If you have walked into a elementery school in just the past year, you will notice some very different souroundings.

Some elementery schools have laptops for every student, which makes it easyer than ever for a teacher to make and publish an assinment.

As I personly wittnesed my siblings having homework over the weekend, and Fridays, both of which, I never had in elementer school.

03ae0c4,"The Electoral college is something that has been around for hundreds of years, and has helped us decide what to do. It is a fair method of electing the president, but it is not what we need anymore. Times have changed since that was established, so it is time we use a good old-fashioned way of voting, and use election by popular vote.

Back in the seventeenth century, when the Electoral College was created to find a balance between citizen voting and majority vote. How it works, is we select the electors representing our state's votes, they meet and vote, and then congress counts their votes. Also, all states, except Maine and Nebraska have something called the ""winner-take-all"" syatem, and that is a ""system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.""(s1,p7) But now, the citizens in your state who qualify as a voter cast their votes. Instead of that being what our state's choice is, we choose the electors of our candidate, or person we voted for, and then the candidate with the majority votes wins, getting atleast 270 out of 538 electoral votes. This seems very unfair, and in one specific case, it is. In the 2000 presidential election, between Al Gore and George Bush, Al Gore got more popular votes than George Bush; he should have won. But Bush had more electoral votes, and that was where is mattered. So, Bush won that. If Gore won popularity wise, he should have won, hense creating happier citizens, since he won the majority of their votes.

Another argument, according to source 3, paragraph 23, is that the Electoral College method of choosing the president, ""may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" This is very important, as we all want a good leader who will support our home state. If, for example, the Electoral College voted on a Democrat, and he won, Florida may not have much hope. Florida is a Republic state, as is most of the southern states; yes, Mr. President would be obligated to help all 50 states when necessary, but the bigger benefits would go towards the Democratic states, and probably his home state. Therefore, voters may not even bother casting in a ballot if the candidate of their choice does not have much hope, or if they think either potential leader will benefit them. So if they do not have much of a choice in the matter, they lose interest and shrug it off, as opposed to if it were popular vote, and every single vote was accounted for. Fortunately, though, this does not happen often; one meesly vote does not do much to turn the tables.

The Electoral College, all-in-all, has helped us a lot, yes, but it is high time we go back to the popularity vote. It would make most citizens, and many potential voters, happier to know that they are accounted for, and we won't have the potential of the popularity winner, the one the people actually voted for, to lose on account of the electors. It should be the people of America's decision, not a group of government workers, to decide who runs our nation.    ",3

So many students using computers for school aren't getting the full potential out of their computers. They stay confused and move on hoping they don't fall behind evryone else.

All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

"" As an official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg is a credible source for information regarding transportation in America. However there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems. Limiting car usage could help solve many of those issues.

In America, the topic of alternative transportation has been  discussed many times, but in previous bills, 80% of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This can be found in paragraph 9 of the first source as the fifth line. Sadly America is not the only country having problems. In

Paris, France , diesel cars make up 67% of the vehicles and the diesel feul is blamed for the smog accumulation in the city. In Paris, A warmer layer of air caused by cold nights and warm days, trapped the car emissions which then caused a five day period of intensifying smog. France's smog build-up rivaled that of

Beijing, China , which is claimed to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. This problem also exists in the States, as transportation is the second largest cause of America's emissions, right behind power plants. To ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined 22- euros or $31.

Bogota, Columbia followed France in their violation fee and charged any violater $25. Bogota has created a

Day Without Cars , in which no cars are used, to promote alternative transport and the reduction of smog levels. Another positive effect no cars can have would be a more peaceful enviroment, as stated in sources 1 and 3. In America, recent studies show that Americans have been buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Although it may be far in the future, America may soon follow the lead of

Vauban, Germany , where it is completely car-free. This probably won't happen anytime in the near future, but the use of automobiles has gone down in the United States. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor company, proposed a city in which, pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, etc. are used to save time, lower emissions and improve safety. He sees this future, hopefully others will too.

Although America might not be exactly like Vauban, it is good to hope that it will get there someday. No cars would result in a calmer atmosphere and a more peaceful lifestyle. Also, it would lower the emissions made by vehicles, which in turn would save the atmosphere, thus saving life on earth. No cars would also help improve safety, both of animals and of people. We may not be completely there yet, but the world will someday have no need for cars and that will be the first step into the future.    ",2
03c75d3,"Technology has evolved in amazing, big, and even complex ways. It's 2018, and there are robots that can now engage in combat, imitate humans, and open doors. It's no surprise that now there are computors that can read your emotions. Will it be benefical? I, in fact, do think this new software, the Facial Action Coding System, will be benefical, especially in classrooms. This new technology can help keep students interested in learning, awake in class, and even help teachers with teaching.

The Facial Action Coding System can indeed help keep students interested in learning. Why? First off, it's new technology. Who wouldn't be excited to get to use and experience something like this? From personal experience, I know that when I first started using computers and Ipads in middle school, it made me more excited to do work and come to class. This software can also keep students interested in learning because if the system notices the student becoming bored, it could modify the lesson, as stated in the article. When modifying the lesson, it could maybe become more animated or louder for the student's attention to be grabbed, thus spiking his or her interest.

This new software could help keep students awake in class because, as stated in the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article, if the system notices that the student is falling alsleep, it could change the lesson, make it simpler, or make it more interesting to grab the student's attention. This effect can be similar to a human instructors, which can enhance the student's mood and energy level. Usually, humans lose interest and become tired when bored or when something is repetitive, and as stated above in my first point, making the lesson more animated or louder could prevent the student from losing interest, which could lead to dozing off.

And for my last point, putting this technology in classrooms for students, could actually benefit the student and the teacher at the same time. If the program notices that the student is becoming bored or losing interest, this could be a sign to the teacher to adopt a new teaching style or change up the presentation to better engage the student. Using this as an advantage could help strengthen the relationships between the students and the teachers to ensure a better, more effective, and easier learning environment for the students and an easier, more effective teaching environment for the instructors.

The addition of the Facial Action Coding System to classrooms today will absolutely benefit not only teachers, but also students. It'll first off, keep students awake to even learn the lesson, then proceed to keep the students interested in the lesson being taught, and overall will help teachers know how to best connect with his or her students and provide the best and most effective way of teaching to them. And not only do the benefits stop here, but they go on and on, adding paint to the big picture. This software can be used in even preschools and colleges. Ensuring that the students are being taught in the best way will heighten their academic skills and will provide a promising future full of success. Just from starting with the projection of a smile.

03ce0a7,"Imagine a world with driveless cars. While that world is coming to picture, be sure to also imagine all the things that could possibly go wrong. Imagine an increase in car accidenets because a malfunction occured in one of the cars. All the money and time that is being invested in this one specific project. Teenagers no longer getting excited about being able to get their license. Seems like a not so great world to live in.

Manufactors may promise people that their smart cars are safe and reliable, nothing will go wrong. But what they dont tell people is that they messed up on a couple thounsand cars, no biggie. The smart cars are no longer alerting the driver for when they need to take over. The spinning sensor just breaks down, with no warning whatsoever. That is one of the most important parts of the whole system. Everything could go wrong. Promises are broken by family; companies can easily break promises too.

So much money and time could be put into better and more useful things. This all started back in the 1950s with General Motors. Google has had working driveless cars since 2009. All of that time and money should have been invested into something that tis world needs. The United States of America has been in debt for a long time, but instead of paying off some debt we build driveless cars.

Teenagers are excited about finally being old enough to get thier permit, their first car. That is what the majority of us look foward too. We finally feel like an adult and have some freedom. With driveless cars, how would this all work out? In the pasage it says, ""... no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore.."" That is no fun. What will we have to look foward to now? No one will need cars.

I am against driveless cars. They may be what we dream of but that doesnt mean they are best for us. Malfuctions could occur which causes a rise in accidents. Possibly even death. Money and time is wasted on this project and it is not what the world needs. The world does not need driveless cars. Teenagers need to experience freedom early, by getting their license and having their own car. If we will no linger have any point for cars in the future, how will teenagers expeince the early life of adulthood? ",4
03d074f,"Mr. Senator,

I think that the Electoral College is a decent way to vote for president. But is it really the best way? Though the Electoral College elects presidents in a way favored by many, it doesn't allow for people to directly vote for the president. Because of that, the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to election by popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College can make things unfair. As stated in the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College"", ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Source 2). That statement basically says that when a voter goes to vote, they aren't voting for the president, but for someone to go and vote for them. Also, who exactly are the people we go and let vote for the person leading our country? According to the article, ""Electors can be anyone not holding public office"" (Source 2). The people who go and vote can't control who these electors vote for. That's just another way that the Electoral College can be unfair to the voters.

Along with being unfair to the voters, the Electoral College can also be unfair to other people as well, for example, the canidates actually running for president. In an article that is for the Electoral College, it states that, ""...the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (Source 3). Does this mean that the Electoral College may have been a good system a while ago, and maybe not as good this day in age? Yes, it does. Also, in the article, it states, ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" (Source 3). That being said, there is always a chance that the result of an election will not be what the country as a whole wants, but what the electors want.

To conclude, the Electoral College is a very interesting proccess that everyone should know about. But I believe that the Electoral College should be a process that stays in textbooks to be learned about, not to actually be used. The Electoral College should be gone and be changed to election of popular vote. After all, the Preamble to the Constitution says, ""We the people"", not ""We the electors"".

03d8fe8,"Imagen being in a regular classroom. Imagen yourself not understing the topic. Imagen not being able to tell the teacher you don't get it because you're afraid to be made fun of. This is what the Facial Action Coding System prevents student from experiencingwhen taught a new topic. This helps student by having the system already knowing they don't understand to topic they had just learned. Although Facial Action Coding System watches your face is wierd, it'll help out teachers and students because it'll help our classroom be more understanding, helpful, and communicate better.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be more understanding.

In the article, it states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelling simply by the look on her face (paragraph 5)."" It also states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears in you screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnet (paragraph 6)."" These quotes show that classrooms can be more understanding with this system. Because if you frown, the teacher will be notified and will ask if you understand yet or need help. And this system will help teachers to more ""calculated"" of what their class needs more work on. And understand the topic they have learned.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be helpful. In the article it states,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor (paragraph 6) ."" This means that this system can be helpful by providing information to the teacher. And so the teacher can have an effective teaching plan to help out the class in learning the topic better. So they don't get lost and confused on the topic.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms communicate better. In the article it said,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. ""Most humans communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to undersatnd that, too(paragraph 6)."" This all means that this sysytem will help us communicate better. And because most of human communication happens nonverbally. It won't be too diffcult to do. This system will help the students and the teacher to communicate with each other effectivly without saying a word.

In concluion, better communication, more helpful, and more understanding are some of the pros of having the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom. Although having the Facial Action Coding System watch your face is pretty weird. Other than that, it's pretty cool that it can help the student(s) and the teacher. The students get a chance to work together to help the teacher understand them better. This system helps them communicate better overall. And helps the teacher to create a better and effective teaching plan overall, too. This Facial Action Coding System helps the student and the teacher to understand, comunicate and help each other.

03da458,"I feel like driverless cars are a great idea. It's truly great from how i see it a sign of the future. People should really see this on a positive note, you get so much from a driverless car. Driverless car is the future of things it is for the better of mankind. Hopefully people see it the way i see it.

You get so much from a driverless car don't know why some states would outlaw the use of driverless cars I could see why they would worry, for the pedestrians, drivers, and passengers. cause after all safety is the most important but if they would actually overlook the bad consiquences and see driverless car use isn't bad. After all the way the driverless cars are being made now are way more safer with all new features. All these car companies making driverless cars I'm pretty sure they're making it way safer. The law should be taking out of these states and see how safe driverless cars are.

The driverless car has all these great features that I do not understand why some would be against it. For example, BMW announced the development of "" Traffic Jam Assistant"". Which means that the car can handle driving funtions at speed up to 25 mph, but the touch sensors it has make sure the driver has their hands on the wheel. It's come pretty far to where the car can steer, accelerate and brake themselves. Also GM

has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is about to back into an object. Also thoughts of some manufacturers consider using camers to make sure the driver is focused on the road.

The future is near with how it's come from driving to driverless cars. all the technology going into this car and off like the specially designed roads for specially designed cars. also car manufacturers like Audi, Mercedes Benz, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. That is coming soon we're in the year 2016 and it's just 4 more years away the future is calling. Driverless cars are just the beginning of the future nothing better than that.

In conclusion I am all for driverless cars like I've said it's a great Idea. With all the technology in the self driven car and the beauty in it. Sure some states and people are against it with worrying about safety and thats understandable but soon they'll see all the good a self driven car can be and some states will go down on that law. Also like i said it is the future for driving and we'll need to adapt we always have and i know we''ll adapt to driverless cars. I approve driverless cars.",4
03dc26a,"Is the Facial Action Coding System really worth it to put it in schools and other places. This new idea can tell how you're feeling by just the scan of your face. There is alway error in such things known as technology. The idea of a scanning machine can tell how I feel seems a little different.

I don't believe this type of machines should be in our schools. I feel like this could cause confusion anf distrut form kids who don't like it. Sometimes kids like to keep to themselves and don't want some tecaher walking around taking pictures. How do we know if this is truly right. lets say that some kids get areading that they're happy or super sad when really they don't feel like that at all. There's to much error to have happen that it just doesn't seem worth it. If this has actually never been trieed on a living human who says it works. How do we know that Mona Lisa really felt like that. She can't tell us that she's dead.

With schools we need to worry on more important stuff. at times we seem to wonder why we lose out on so much money this just doesn't seem like a good investemnt. There is to much that can go wrong and not enough that can go right. Maybe later on if this was perfected but for now I don't support this. Maybe one day this will work out I just don't see it anytime soon becoming the next big thing.                                         ",2
03e687e,"Are you excited to get that new car you've been saving all your hard works money for? Cant wait to drive whenever you want and not have a care about where you go? Maybe us as a society has the wrong idea of cars and what they do for us. Cars have been givin this impression that they are what us young adults want and need to become an adult or even for some people ''cool'' but we've got the wrong idea.

Americans use cars almost everyday, numerous times a day, spening loads of money on gas and filling up our ozone with pollution but for most lifes outisde the United States they prefer to walk, bike ride, run anything except a car. Vaubran ,Germany have given up their cars. 70% of Vaubrans families do not own cars and about 57% sold a car to move there. Giving that most subrub lifes are over populated there would be no room for all those cars, but if you're that person that needs a car you must buy a space for 40,000, along with a home. ''When I had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way'' said by Heridrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, as she walks the busy path ways of Vauban streets. MOst countries are like Vauban, over populated with little to no car usage. Most people travel by foot, bus or bike and have been proven to not only heelp save thier environment but save lifes but you still have some countries that work like America. Bogota, Colombia does us cars very frequent but has a ''car free'' day which a large amount of Colombias population (7 million) participates in. '' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode with his wife on a two seat bicycle as it poured. '' The rain didnt stop people from participating'', ''We enjoy this, its better for us as a society''. Many other countries saw this remarkable change that they were trying to accomplish and really were motivated to cut cars out and start walking, biking..

Paris, France typically has more smog than other European capitals. The cause for this smog is to be said it comes from the Diesel fuel since Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles droven in France. The smog was so serious and dangerous that it traveled to Beijing China, which they did not need since they are the most populate city in the world.  France and lots of other countries have smog/ pollution problems caused by cars. France has plug-in cars, hybrids, more cars carrying three or more passangers, and public transport free of charge Friday threw Monday clogging up our o-zone. Many people across the globe have notice this big error its causing and try to make a stop to it. Lots of citizens try to cut back on their driving or try to find closer areas to work or for school to make it easier them to walk, bike ride to. For instance, the sons of Michael Sivak who are in their 20's travel by foot since driving was ''not a big concern for them.'' ''They organize their summer jobs and social lifes around where they can walk, take public transport or car pool with friends''. Even young adults are seeing the greatness in doing something good for them and thier environment.

Driving is a big part of our world today, but we have some people and even countries who have to or choose to do it by foot. Its proven to help the mind  and also proven to help with our environment and our safety life. Pollution fills the air but so does the people, making the world a better place to live and causing less stress to the citizens that do so.            ",3

The residents of the community have given up their cars.  Street parkings and driveways are forbidden in the new district near the French and swiss borders. the streets are completely empty except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community. In addition, 70% of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. A growing trend going around they say they want to seperate them from auto use, a saying called ""smart planning"". the efforts that they put in that some people build their own houses to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions from tailpipes. In Europe they are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United states.

In conclusion, there have been effortsain the past two decades to make the cities more dense, and better for walking. Home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, this may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. above all this, stores are placed on about a walk away, on a main street rather then along some distant highway. According to them how much you drive is as important as weather you have a hybrid. Suburbs will spread out the homes were thwe dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. in the developing world where they will increase number of private cars ownd by the middle class. In the United states, the enviromental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legistlators are starting to act cautiously. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role.

Above all of this paris bans driving due to smog. days after near record pollution they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or get charged with a 31$ fine. the same thing would apply tot he odd numbers the following day. about almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to the reuters, and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. it was down by 605 in the capital of France, after a five days of horrible smog, it rivaled that Beijing, china, which was known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cold air and warm days would cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Deisels make up to 67% of vehicles in france, campared to 53.3% rest of Western Europe, according to reuters. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. paris had 147 per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, reuters found.

Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while eceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. In a program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked skated or took buses to work during a car free day. It was the third year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital of 7 million. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violaters faced 25$ fines. It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution they said.

03ee9ea,"In this article it talked a lot about how maybe schools could use computers to sensor a student's emotion of either getting bored or losing interest and to be able for the computer to change the lesson slightly to get the students attention, But do you think this would really work? In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. Why? Because some students may have diformaties in their muscles in their face, facial piercings that could afftect they way the computer reads your emotion, or even just simply you face might be showing one expression but you may feel another way.

Not everyone in the world is same so it's really hard to make something like this that would benefit everyone. You also have to think about the cost of these computers, just think normal computers are already expensive, but ones that can read your emotion you can imagaine that those prices would be unbelievable.

As well as every student learns differently, so if the computer changes the way the lesson is being taught based off of your emotion when maybe the lesson is already clear to you, could make it harder on some students. So overall I believe that this product wouldn't be very successful due to a lot of the roadblocks in the way, especially with money involvment. ",2

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson"". If the computer could understand when the student is having a problem and can effectively fix that issue, then this could be the best way to teach. The use of reading students emotional expressions is valuable, because they can be taught better.

""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D comuter model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles...

03f958f,"""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" Cars that can drive independently are a huge advancement in technology, travel, saftey, and history. Driverless cars, which they are called, are a positive and wonderful thing to have. This essay will provide why driverless cars should be developed.

Although there has been a large leap in vehicle technology, the cars are not yet completely driverless. With more and more research and test being done there will one day be a completely driverless car.

When the vechicle was first invented it took many trial and errors but it was never given up on. The driverless car is in the stage of developement and should not be given up on. People do not forget the first model vechicle because it changed history and made things easier and more convient. The same thing can happen with the driverless car.

""Their (Google) cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.""

Crashes can be caused by anything, but having vehicles that drive the exact same could potentially reduce the risk of accidents. In the driverless cars, drivers are still needed to stay alert at the wheel because the car cannot handle obstacles such as: passing constrcution or passing accidents. They need to continue to test and develope the driverless car so one day it can over come these obstacles.

With all cars there are dangers. If the driver of the driverless car is to cause an accident then the driver is held responsible. This car cannot promise hundred percent safety, and neither can any other vehicle. That does not let automakers stop them from continuing their work. The more reseach and developement they do the more problems they can resolve. Car manufactures have plans to make cars compelety capable of driving themselves.

The driverless car may take a few years to be made perfect, but automakers are not willing to give up. A driverless car can be good for technology advances, safety, travel, and a mark in history. Driverless cars need to be backed and have support in order to be completely succsessful. And the more developement and reseach done the closer automakers become to creating a change in history, a driverless car.",3
03fb253,"Luke is a boy signing up with his friend Don,here's some reason's why you should also sign up like Luke did himself. My first reason is you can help people while you travel like how Luke did when he went to europe to help people restock on supplies,food,and animals. You can also go because,while you're shipping animals across seas you can spend time with somepretty amazing animals. Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe. These are all great in my point of view because even its some hard work it can still be enjoyable because there is just so much to see like how I mentioned the animals before,and of course the sightslike ruins,structures,and much more. Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made. THis is a good idea because even thogh its hard work and a little bit dangerous Luke stayed positive because of him stating ""The cattle boat trps were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy"" meaning he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy. Now even though its still fun to be a seagoing cowboy there is still dangers. The ocean is a pretty dangerous place so it'll still be a hard job especially when it comes to storms. If a serious storm hits while on a boat trip it could still be pretty devastating someone could get knocked off and go into the ocean,one of the animals could fall off,and someone cold slide and break something when they have a hard fall. Even though its still pretty dangerous and pretty hard work for someone it can still be enjoyable Im not going to say the same stuff I already said earlier so Im just going to say that depending on how it goes and how you act about it it will be enjoyable just wait and see.",2
03ff4c1,"First of all, NASA only gets their information from research and cameras which they depend on to help them with their research too. According to the text it states,""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible. To add to that it has been twenty five years since the discovery, and there is not a for sure explanation that is logical because some people think there is smething behind it.

Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. According to the text it says,""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" Even scientists believed it too and NASA has logical thinkers in their coorporation too.

Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped.

Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about. Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life?

In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.               ",3
03ffbb2,"Imagine a town where the streets are empty of cars and stores and shops are just a walk down main street.  Well that town exists, its called Vauban, Germany a town on the border of the swiss and france.  People who live there gave up their cars and now live a different type of life.  Most people who have done this are happy they can just walk to places.  Back in the 50's this would be the town to live in.  It still has a strong appeal to people.  The way it is run makes it one of the most intresting town in europe.

This plan worked for them why cant we do this in Bradenton?  Now this type of town would benifet anyone.  People would save money.  The town or city would make double or even more of what they are making in public transportation.  The enviornmet would get healthy and make any town less polluted and help in the fight of greenhouse gases.

We all know how expensive gas can be and how it goes up and down.  With cars being took out the only thing we'd need gas for is buses that would transport us.  Our wallets will thank us and so will the planet.

Speaking of the planet greenhouse gases are the talk of the town and will not stop unless we do spmething.  We can help by doing this plan.  We can never undo what we have done to the ozone layer.  However we can certainly not make it worse by doing this.  In fact we could cut down pollution and make bradenton the city it once was.

04030c7,"Although it does seem like looking back to the past is the right thing, sometimes changing the past can have good effects for the future. The founding fathers that established the United States Constitution also established the Electoral College. Even though it has been used for many years it is the not most accurate form of voting. The popular vote is much more accurate in which the citizens of the United States vote for who they want.

One of the many problems with the Electoral College system is that the citizens of that state don't vote for president. Instead they vote for electors which then vote for president. They vote for the electors that they think are trustworthy and are going to vote for the candadite they want to win. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors an end of voting for the wrong candidate. In addition there can be a tie in the Electoral College and in that case the election would be thown to the House of Reprsentatives where state delegations vote on the president.

Every state receives an amount of point decided by the population of that state. ""It is unfair for voters because of the winner takes all system."" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) If a state is won by only 3 votes the candidate that wins the state, takes all the points for that state. Therefore it is possible to win the Popular vote and lose the Electoral Vote. In that case the winner of the electoral vote would be pronounced president of the United States of America.

The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Each state has a favorable amount of democrats or republicans, therefore, candidates don't go to states or run ads in states they know the cannot win due to the state being to far into the enemy party. States that change from a democrat to a republican state and vice versa are called ""swing"" states. Those are states that the candidates running for president will want to visit and run ads in.

Electoral College has followed us since the Constitution was established, but it is time that we leave it behind and look to a new voting system. We need to abolish Electoral College because it is an unreliable way for to run the campaign for becoming the president of the United States of America.    ",3
040ba87,"I argue in changing the electoral college , popular vote would be a chance for normal americans to get there voice heard in the government. A big problem is how the voters votes go straight to the electoral college and wouldnt make a change at all also how theres a bigger chance of a tie happening in the electoral college then by popular vote

One reason why the electoral college should go is because the voters votes arent really being heard. For example in paragraph 10 it says that ' under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect for the president "" , thats techinally saying that the electors are the ones who are really voting our voice means nothing we could have wanted another president to have won but if the electoral college gets more votes then us then so be it , thats our new president! We dont even know who the electors really are they could have been picked by anyone like how it says in paragraph 10 they could have been picked by the presidential candidates themselves who knows. They say we control who the electors vote for but not always , theres a high unlikely chance that there would be more popular votes for one president like in texas for john kerry that all 34 electors would go to congress and vote for john kerry thats insane.

A second reason is how theres a bigger chance of electoral college tie happening then a popular vote one like how it says in paragraph 12 "" in 1916 , a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and a 3,3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"". If the electoral college has a tie then theres even a bigger chance of the people voice not being heard at all. Once a tie happens the election goes to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president as said in paragraph 12 , a single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have no say compared to the 55 representatives from California that makes Wyoming have no voice in the election compared to Califorina. The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

Finally thats all i have to say regarding how the election should be changed to having the popular vote determine the president , we want our voice to be heard! Sometimes the electoral college doesnt pick the president that we wanted and if there was a tie to happen in the electoral college which is at high risk some of the states voices wouldnt get heard at all , thats why we should switch over to popular vote maybe more people would actually get up and go vote because they would know their vote actually means something. Like it says in paragraph 14 "" Abolish the electoral college! "".    ",4
040bb8a,"I feel as though driverless cars are very contoversial. The are some pros and cons to having a computer control a car. With that being said I feel as though driverless cars are not something that should happen, at least not now. There are far too many complications that come with not having to drive.

There is a fine line between needing something and deserately wanting it, and I feel as though cars that don't need drivers are something that people just want. I feel as though the amount of people that need driverless cars pales in comparison to what else could be done with the money that is spent on driverless cars. In the passage, it clearly stated that an idea for driverless cars is ridiculously expensive. Granted the idea was from the 1950s, but there is no doubt that to total cost of driverless cars would still be outrageous. Driverless cars just seem unneccesary because the money spent on driverless cars could go towards something better, like starving children or homeless people.

Another flaw of having driverless cars are the danger of it. Technology is no where near perfect and one small mistake in the car could cause a ginormous car accident. What if a child darts out infront of a car, and there is no driver to stop it? What if there is an accident and the driverless car doesn't detect it? There are too many possibilities for something that isn't a neccessity.

So far driverless cars aren't even driverless. People still need to sit in the front seat and they still need to be alert at all times. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating throigh work zones and around accidents."" Also there isn't a set date for when the driverless cars will get done. Car companies plan on releasing some driverless cars in 2020, but there are compliations that could arise and slow down the process.

Driverless cars seem cool and they could make things easier for the human population. However cars that don't need drivers are something that the world doesn't need right now. There are too many ""what-ifs"" that come with driverless cars. Besides there are more useful things that people could be putting their money, focus, and time on. Building shelters for people in need, donating food and water to sountries that have a lack of, and attempting to make the world a safer place for people are thing that people should be focusing on. Not just a new car that seems cool.",4
04128c7,"Driving cars that could drive you anywhere as in a taxi or your own car are finally coming to our furture and comig fast. There are many people out there who disagree on the idea Google has came out with. There are many different reson why you should and should buy this car they can be seen in positives and negatives. My reason when it comes to buying a driveless car is that you should or try to get a driveless car, but on the other had there are some bad reason why you shouldnt.

First few positive reasons I think you should buy this car is because its a proven fact that it can lower the risk of texting a driving. Since the 2000s the rate of texting and rving drivng has went up a massive of numbers. And plus they made a few models of the google car back in 2000 for a special track and it proved that its safe and could lower the stakes of a accident. They took one to the street and drove it 1 million miles and havent even crashed yet. But when it comes to parking and coming in a drive way its up to the driver to do that.

Then when it comes down to the gas its very conservant. For an example when the driver is sleepy or had a long day at work they can take a little nap whe its in driveless mode. If there are any roadblocks or construction problems the car will alert the driver that it is time to take action and drive. And if there is any misconveince the car will knock down the speed to about 25 mph. This furture car can turn, accelerate and even brake. Is this what we been waiting for all of our lifes?

Finaly when it comes down to buying this car do it!! Who would ever imagine a car driving itself when ever the driver needs it to. Like a friendly robot that is always there for you when you need them. In this few positives and barely any negatives my addvice is add the new car to your collection or garage. ",3
041804e,"Are you confused, angry, or sad? What if a computer could help you understand more to take away your confusion. Technology has been advancing little by little and we are at the point in time where a computer is now able to read your face and emotions. Two professers have been working hard to create a new software that can recognize emotions. They are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

The use of technology in the classroom is huge. Most students are now learning lessons planned by their techers' via laptops and etc. Sometimes students struggle to comprehend their teahcer's lessons and tend to be confused because of the way they are taught. Every student learns a different way and sometimes the teacher runs out of options to help the student understand. Now, computers have a different mind. They are more ""intelligent"" than humans. They can program different things for different people. This new software could be very valubale in a classroom because it can help explain things in ways that a teacher can't and will be able to adjust to the students comprehension.

Math can be a very stressful and difficult subject to comprehend. Sometimes teachers cant explain how to solve an equation easily which is how computers could help do those things. If you're reading through your teachers lesson and see his/her explanation on how to solve but you don't quite understand it, you tend to make a face of confusion. The computer may read that and see that you are having difficulty understanding the issue and may make the work easier for you to understand.

Last but not least, some student's tend to get frustrated or annoyed and decide to give up. A student giving up is not a good thing because they then don't learn what they were meant to learn. The computer may notice that a child is getting annoyed or upset and can find a different more fun and entertaining way to help the student. Just a simple change in the form of the lesson may give a student motivation to learn instead of quitting and giving up. Sometimes all a student needs is for something to be adjusted to their understanding and level.

This software created by two professers could be very valuable in a classroom. There are many benefits it could bring but there are some problems it could cause as well. Overall, this software will have a positive effect to help a child know they can be helped to understand what they dont. It could produce a new learning enviornment to the students comprehension and many test grades and etc could improve. ",4
042167f,"In Europe, a new trend has started. Many towns have banned the ownership of cars. One town that this happened in is Vauban, Germany. In this town, citizens are living lives without a lot of stress. They enjoy riding tandem bikes with their wives and walking alone. In Paris, the act has been picked up. Since it's so popular, Paris streets hold many cars. Now that the temporary law has passed, the amount of smog has dropped dramaticaly.

When cars aren't used, lives are saved. Car accidents happen very often and oftentimes they are fatal. When you have a car, you become able to get a DUI. Owning a car can bring you extensive fines, even when you make a small accident in a fraction of a second.

With the economy the way it is, who can even afford a nice car? Bikes are much cheaper and safer for people as well as the environment. If everyone in the world stopped using their cars for a month, we might be able to save a species from dying out, or maybe slow the desintegration of the ozone layer. In Yosemite, wolves flee from the roads because of the massive amount of death it causes their species.

Suburban cities are working on making everything walking distance. On the weekends, public transportation is free. If you have an electric car or you're carpooling three or more people, you're allowed to drive in these cities. Because of these new laws that are being tested in certain areas, many people don't have their licenses. Many teenagers today aren't concerned with being able to drive, and many adults live close enough to their workplace to walk there. Although the laws restricting driving can seem very restricting, they will save lives and will give society a chance to have a smarter, cleaner, and safer future.         ",2
0425a6e,"In this article the author is talking about going to Venus. The author explains the reasons why we should explore this planet. The author mentions that they should study Venus despite the danger it presents. Venus is the closest planet from the Earth in terms of density, size, and occasionally in distance too. Is Venus so inhospitable, why do scientist want to learn more of this planet? Venus has been proven a very challenging place to examine more closely.Why is it so important to visit Venus? What are the risks of going to Venus? What would the conditions be to go to Venus?

Venus is the second planet from our sun. Not even a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. Each previous mission was unmanned, no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Studyng Venus is a challenge to humans. Venus atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Of any planet from our solar system Venus has the hotterst surface. Astronomers believe that Venus once was like Earth. In tis article it it mentioned that long ago Venus used to be covered lagerly by oceans and problaby had many forms of life. Venus still have certain characteristics that relate to the Earth like valleys, mountains, craters, and rocky sediments. Returning to Venus is indisputable, scientists and astronomers are trying to figure out the ways to make this mission safe and scientifically productive? The NASA has an idea to sending humans to study Venus. This idea would allow them to float above the fray, temperatures would still be at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However researchers cannot take samples of any kind from a distance. Nasa researchers are working on safer ways to study Venus. Reseachers are thinking in using old technology called mechanical computers. But why not use modern computers and more advanced technology?

Well modern technology is tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. This challenge is to human curiosity which will lead to equally intimidating endeavors.

In conclusion in order to visit Venus there are many dangers that could occur. But how the author suggested despite the dangers. In the article mentions many danger of visiting Venus and the ways reseachers are trying to find to visit Venus safe and to learn. Studying Venus would help humanity to discover new things.

There will be dangers in this challenge but it's worth it. The author explains why they should study Venus and give details and explains the dangers of this challenge.",3
0429d4a,"I'm against having driverless cars because I don't think that driverless cars will ever work properly without getting into a wreck on its own. The cars wouldn't even be driverless because it would have to have a person turn them into and out of a driveway or dealing with complicated issues dealing with traffic. You're not just assisting a car you are driving the car still. It isn't 100% on its own on the road you would still have to help steer at certain spots. Therefore they can't be trusted because you could be approaching a stoplight that has a lot of traffic and then your car wouldn't stop you would have to stop it before it caused a wreck.

I would feel much more safe if I had just a regular, normal car that I could drive 100% of the time. The only safe car is a car that has a person in it and driving it. If it was a choice between the driver or the manufacturer I would definately say that it was the manufacturer because a good driver wouldn't wreck, or get injured. The car would though because a self driving car couldn't work and would cause way more wrecks than what there are now. Therefore I would never let a self driving car drive me around.

Like I said it wouldn't even be 100% on its own just the driving straight part of it. The car wouldn't be able to turn or go into traffic on its own, but a person can. That's why I'm against Driverless Cars and why I don't think that any of them would work.",2
042b0cd,"State senator I ask that you favor the idea of keeping the Electoral College instead of changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

Even though the Electoral College is a despised method for choosing the president it has it's reasons. I'll show you why I am in defense of the Electoral College.

We need a president that would regard all of our interests and concerns. Someone can't just appeal to one region and expect to win because "".. a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president.""(source 3) due to no region having the amount to guarantee the electoral votes to elect a president. Dealing with votes it is a problem to have a run-off election. One of the concerns with Electoral College is that "".. voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" stated in source 2. But the Electoral College simplifies that problem with the electoral votes. Remarked in source 3 it says ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively.)"" without the Electoral College it would have complicated the election procces but thanks to the Electoral College reduces the complication and produces a clear winner.

To win, the majority of the states have a system that gives all the electors votes to the winning candidate except Maine and Nebraska having their own way of proportional representation which is explained in source 1. This gives the certainty of a result, for example in source 3 it says that "".. even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landside electoral-vote victory in that state"" this makes it highly unlikely for a tie. The Electoral College gives political balance to large states (population wise) higher the population the more problems, concerns ,or interests is needed to be attend to. Like how source 3 says "" .. a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...""

To me all these reasons should prove to you that even though the Electoral College has its problems it's benefits outweigh it. So being in favor of keeping the Electoral College is the right choice don't you think so too?    ",4
042dc86,"In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", the author makes great points for and against driveless cars. Some of his arugements for driveless are very interesting and definitly out weighs the cons of driveless cars. Threes three main points that he made for driveless cars and how fast we're coming closer to having them everywhere. With driveless cars you can have you car drive up to 25mph, brake when you're to close to another car, and they can also notify the driver if he or she isn't paying attention to the road. Everyday we're getting close and closer to having complete driveless cars!

In 2013 BMW made a car that can handle speeds up to 25mph and they also added a really inavaiting feature in it; The car has special touch sensors that alert you anytime you take your had off the wheel. There's so many benfits to this. Let say someone is speeding four times over the speed limit and you have to move out the way before they can hit you, with your hands being on the wheel and the car driving you can move out the way and take complete control of the car. Another example is if you were driving your son/daughter to their friend's house and you had to look for which house you can sit the car to do the driving while you're looking for the house and that alone can help a may reduces finder benders in neighbrohoods because the car can break when its getting close to another car all on its own.

Noitifcations. Some car companies have been trying to make cars that have a hands up flashing light on the windsheld when you take your hands off the when or aren't paying attention to the road. This idea can help pervent so many accendents and help improve drving skills.

In conclusion all these ideas and all this new terchonology in cars will help stop and lower the percentage of accidents dramaticlly. Anywhere from having the car break on its own to drving a certain speed limit while you look for your childs friend's house can help stop so many accidents. We are getting closer and closer to a safer drving age each and everyday.        ",3
0435f85,"The author didnt support this claim very well. The author talked alot about the dangers in Venus rather the good that comes from Venus. I say this because as I am reading I see how the author mentions many of times how Venus has extreme tempetures and how no one has went to Venus because of these extreme conditions.

The author says in paragraph 2 ,""Numerous factors contribute to Venuss reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" Which gives the idea that it is a very dangerous place. You may begin to question ""Why would any one want to go to Venus"" or you may say to yourself ""This is not any where that i would want to go."" The author also states in paragraph 3,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere."" This is even more if a danger sign. No one would want to be anywhere where you could potentially suffocate. We also know from this paragraph that Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The author states in paragraph 6 ,""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" The author gives us tons and tons of reasons why it is not worth going to Venus.

From what I have read today I will never want to go to Venus. The author gave plenty of good reasons on why we should not go to Venus. It is not a place for humas as we have already read. So i feel as if the author did not do a good job supporting his claim on why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present.",3
043d5a8,"I think that driverless cars are a great idea but are not yet a safe one. What happens if soembody gets in a car wreck while being in the driverless car? I'd sure hate to be the manufacturer of that car because I'd be losing a lot of money. Driverless cars arent a bad idea I mean, there can be many pros and cons, but no one is ever 100% sure that their idea is as good as it needs to be before they can sell it to people, especially when a human being would be putting their lives in the responibility of a man made machine.

Driverless cars can be good for many, mainly working people on the road. Say you are a business man/woman and have tons of work to do because your company or business relies on you to make your people look good. Well, theres been a bit of an interfence with your work and didn't have time, but on your way to work you can focus on paper work and anything else that is required and have it done while another co-worker had not completed their paper work on th ewy to work. All because you own a driverless car and can getg more done. But when you think about the cons of riding in a driverless car you get to thinking, ""well what if I'm focusing on business work and my driverless car crashes?"" Who will be responsible? The manufacturer of course, because there was some type of malfunction where the car doesn't respond correctly to the surroundings. Would you put your life in the programming of a driverless car? Yes, they'll save lots of time and money but how much more would the damages cost to trust a driverless car to get you places safely?

In many cases I guess you can say that riding in a driverless car would come in handy. Maybe they arent the best for the roads, but what about using them for tours around the city or maybe creating them to travel only at neighborhood speeds? I'm sure the manufacturers will find a more safe use for driverless cars or possibly a different type of driverlesss automobile. In the beginning, middle, and end I still think in my head that driverless cars are never going to be a legitimate guaranteed safety vehicle. ",2

This system can reconize your emotions. Many peolpe tend to hide their emotions .In the Mona Lisa she is eighty-three percent happy,nine percent disgusted,six percent fearful,and two percent angry. This computer system software helped the Mona Lisa's emotions,which can help us too. This process begins when the compyter constructs a 3D computer model of the face all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Emotion,moving your facialmuscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may even help produce them.

Another reason is this may help you with communication ,this software can help you communicate. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie these muscle cluses are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isnt't being truthful. This helps weather someone fake smiles to you or not. In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. This computer system knows if you are faking it.

This software may also help teachers out. This computer system can tell if students are bored in class,or if they are confused .This system can tell teachers that students need more review on the lesson .This may be a great a idea niot only it helps teachers but,human communcation is nonverbal,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too.

I bielive this is a great idea because,it helps us with our emotions and communicate with others,and help teahers out with students.

043e1a0,"May 24, 2001 was the date it all started. When the ""Face on Mars"" conspiracy began. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling a region of Mars called Cydonia. The Viking 1 was taking snapshots of the Cydonia when it spoted a shadowy figure close of a human face. This snapshot was sent to the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2. After careful review at the mission controllers at the Jet Propulision Lab they found out that it wasn't a human face. It turned out to be Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Although this one had an unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

After a few days of the finding of the ""Face"" NASA unveiled the image for all the public to see. They added a capition to the image that quoted ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors used the photo as a propaganda to get the publics attention to Mars, and it rsulted on good high notes. The ""Face of Mars"" became an pop icon from starring in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkut lines for 25years! Then to clear up that the ""Face"" didn't show signs of life Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped the same image ten times sharper and it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien momument after all. They tried another picture after people wouldn't believe the landform idea and the Martian came equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin said it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In conclusion the image of the ""Face On Mars"" sparked contrivsory in if it was a face or a natural landfrom. You had all the public believing it was a face and NASA saying it was a landform. This challenged NASA to prove that the face was indeed a landfrom. They got sharper images in where it clearly shows a butte/mesa. Although the public didn't believe in NASA it sure did make NASA have a reason for its reaseach. The shared their discoveries with everyone and the public responded.

To begin with, I am in favor of keeping the electoral college because it is more reliable than election by popular vote. When you vote for the presidential election you help select your state's electors when you vote for president of your choice because when you vote for your candidate your actually voting for your candidates electors. As stated in paragraph six in source one. Also these electors aren't just every day people they are carryfully selected to take place in these events. For example, you walk into your local precint to vote on the fourth year on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You enter your voting booth and vote for the president of your choice, so you think. You are actually voting for your states electors. so thats one of the reasons why we should keep the electoral college.

In addition, I am in favor of keeping the electoral college because it is more modern,accurate and reliable. Most people vote for the president of there choice becuase of what they say theyll while in presidency, or how good they look, rescent experince, and how much they like that perticular president. Do you really want some one who knows nothing about the president of thier choice but how good they look,to vote for the the next leader of our country. As stated in paragraph eight in source one it states that the electors represnt our vote and choosse president accordingley. For example, a women walks into her local pricent and decides to vote for the president that looks better that isnt an ancurate vote cause she just voted for the president she likes and what if want to run this country into the ground. so thats why I am in favor of keeping the electoral college.

To conclude, because the electoral college is more reliable and more accuerate is why i am in favor of keeping the electoral college. So on that fourth year on the tuesday after the first monday of november you go into to make your vote make a wise choice and remeber your voting for your state's electors.            ",3
044b201,"With the years, we have changing many things in our society. Since technology, by making new electronic devices, to things in our government, by making new laws and new things to help people in all the country. But, does that mean that we have to change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the presindet of the United States? In my point of view, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution. And there are many evidence to support that keeping the Electoral College is beneficial to our country.

According to the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, and it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of Romney. Almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landsalide electoral vote vistory in that satate. This demostrates, how people accept the fact that they are voting the electors and then for the President and Vice president. This help people by making easily the hour of vote for a candidate.

However, as we can se in the texts above, not everybody things like this. For example, in the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, the author says that according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. But, each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. (Posner, paragraph #16).

Another evidence from the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised mothod of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner,  is when he says ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal"" (Posner, paragraph #19). That means that No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavely in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing huis plurality in states that he knows he will win. ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" That highlights how the Electoral College is trying to helping people vote their candidates and feel safe and comfortables with them.

To conclude, despite the fact many people say that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting  a president, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution that helps our community to help people with thir desicions and make our life more comfortable and easy.

04575a9,"The Disadvantage of Facial Action Coding System

According to TechGen, about 72% of students in the United States get distracted from a technological device, this can be a cell phone, computer, smartwatches, and more. Everyone has at least on technological device. Schools worldwide should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a distraction to students, they are a waste of money, and certain students do not want to show their emotions without being told to.

First, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they can be considered a huge distraction for students. Students worldwide need to learn the materials that is needed in order for them to graduate, the Facial Action is not going to help them at all. Students will also be distracted by it, and they will have a hard time focusing on what is going on in the classroom. If schools put the Facial Action System in all of their classroom, then it's going to be harder to the teacher and/or professor to get the students engaged in the activity. This technological system can be a big waste of money for classrooms.

Next, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a waste of money. According to TechPort, technological devices are increasing every single day with more things being imported to them. Schools have better things to spend their money on, such as sporting equipment, new choices of food, and extension of school building. Putting this Facial Action Coding System in all classroom can be schools go in debt because they'll have a difficult time paying materials off. There are certain students who do not want to show off their emotions.

Finally, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because certain students do not want to show off their emotions without being told to. The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Most of the time students do not want their classmates or teachers to know how they are feeling because it can be embarassing for them to know. Students can be going through a rough time, and it can be discouraging for them to go to classroom knowing that the teachers know how they are feeling.

According to Techop, 62% of all classrooms in the world have at least one computer or technological electronic in their classroom. The majority of the students have at least used a device in their classroom. Schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a distraction to students, they are a waste of money, and certain students do not want to show their emotions without being told to.

459116,"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able  to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.                                                                               ",5
045c7fb,"Bases on the passage I think it would be a good idea to have technology read your emotional expressions in the classroom. Then again students in the class room might not be okay with it. For example,if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow,and it can tell if your becoming confused or bored. Some of they reasons of why Eckon created the new technology might be a little to much of the kids that rather look at the walls and be bored.

In order to get students to want theis new technology, we need to make the school and the creator find more ways to get them to understand why we need it. Make them understand why we feel that we need it. Also give them reasons on why we feel it should be valuable. And what can happen if we did have this type of technolgy.

Since we live in a digital world i feel that people and the students do not really understand why it could be okay to hvae new technology to read your emotional expressions. I think we need this techology for more then one reason. We need this technology because lots of kid go home complaing about why they are stressing so bad. They also got home complaing about being bullied abd not ahve enough time to do their home. And i know teacher now these days try to find better ways to make kids not go home complaing about anything,because there are better ways to get through the problem.

I honestly think that if we did have this new technology to read kids emotioal expressions when would not have as much problems like we do now. It's not bad to try something new for once. Just think about how do you think teachers our school feel when were not paying attention to anything they be talking about. Or how they ask us a question and we have no idea what in the world is going on. Having tchnology would be great for our school,and for our teachers,because they need to know how we feel about they lesson were working on. Teachers also need to know how much kids know.

Having technology that could read your emotional expression would be a big deal. At least for meand the teachers I think,because for me I honeslty sometimes have no idea what in the world be going on when the teacher is talking the same time when i'm trying to get it in my head or understand it my self. Come on now the technology can help you in school. Why not try to have something helpful for you and for your teachers,let along your parnters also. I know yout parents get tried of you kids coming home complaing about how you have so much homework and how you have time to get any of it done. Well here's some help since you students talk about having so much home,not being able to get it done on time,and being bullied at school. Put your phone down and put your head in some books. I bet if you put your head in somes books then you won't be complaing about having some much homework,not being able to get it done on time,and be bullied everyday. Cell phone usage does cause drama and emotional problems. Technolgy to read students emotional expressions would be the best idea in the world to read students emotional expressions,because some kids need it. Even if they feel like they don't, i bet you they do. Not just for the teachers but for the parnters and theirsleves to.                  ",4
045fabf,"Would you think its interesting for computers to analyze your emotion? imagine a computer showing if you're sad, wouldn't that be cool? Well if you think thats cool, Dr. huang and his colleague are creating new ways to figure out people's emotions through computers!

That is a good idea because this could impact investigation, like cops figuring out who the're dealing with. For example, say there was a bank robbery and the criminals got away, but soon the cops found them and arrested them, they could either sit down with them and try and work their way around to see if the're is something wrong with them or they could just snap a picture and figure out thier expressions by using the FACS, (Facial Action Coding System). that would make it easier on investigators because the artical says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly"". using video imagery, the new software tracks the facial movements in a real face. This technolgy can improve how well things are animated too, like on tv, and video games. overall i think this is a gonna impact so many cool things that is still to come.

The FACS is gonna change alot of things in a positive way, its going to improve ivestigation and recgonizing different facial expressions to those who are either really happy or really sad and depressed. ",2
045fec2,"Would driverless cars really be helpful to people if they were successfully made? They would probably turn out to be something great if manufacturers succeeded in making these cars. Cars like these sound just as good as flying cars in the future. However, driverless cars do not seem to be a good thing for society. There could be a few problems if this type of car was created and here are some of those problems.

Driverless cars are not good for the society if they are made. Firstly, people would be more lazy than they already are if introduced to this. We already have sensors to help us with driving, so what more do we need. People are already lazy enough today because of technology. This idea would not help society at all if it were introduced to us.

Secondly, in paragraph nine, they state that if one were to be in a car accident, on one will really know who is at fault. In addition to that, people could lie, saying that it was the car's fault, thus people would blame the manufacturers. There could be a lot companies sued because of car accidents and of people who do not want to tell the truth. Also, what happens when a driverless car hits a pedestrian? Driverless could do a lot of bad things and it would all fall on top of the company.

Lastly, there is truly no point in making driverless cars because the driver is not doing a lot in the first place. People know how to drive already and there is no point in making a car that does everything that the driver can already do. This goes back to the laziness part. People also know that there's no point, but yet they decide we should have it because of their laziness. These are some reasons on why driverless cars are not good for society.

Driverless are not a good idea and should not be introduced to society. Honestly, it would step up our game with technology, but we should not waste with something like a driverless car. We can do so much more with this kind technology and should not take it for granted. We should be using our brains for thinking of a way to stop global warming or even the flying car idea sounds nice. To cnoclude, creating driverless cars is not a good idea.   ",3

0467e2a,"Life without cars may seem like a distant dream, but dreams are becoming a reality with new expiremental towns,  banning of driving in some cities, and a national day without cars. Cars are causing, in some cases, more and more pollution everywhere. Although we ignore the signs of pollution everyday, we must face the fact that we are polluting our planet, and something needs to be done about it.

Vauban, Germany. A little city that has a strange law, to live in this city, you must give up your car or pay $40,000 to park it. As a result, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here"" stated Source 1. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and a media trainer stated, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".  This new form of seperate suburban life from auto use is called ""Smart Planning"".  passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissionsin Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States.  With Smart Planning, we can cut back on greenhouse gasses and start to breathe cleaner, healthier air.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"".  Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it.  Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted.  Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars.  The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, 'the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four.  Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries.  Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies.  Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage.  New York started a new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing.  They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

Cars have done enough damage to this earth and its time we fix what we have caused. With all these new eco-friendly and car lacking ideas, we are so close to the isea where we can live without cars taking over our life.    ",4

046e84a,"Unmasking the Face on Mars

The ""face"" on mars has been a very common or popular story, when 25 years ago viking 1 spacecraft snapped a photo of what looked like a two mile long ""face"" that seemed to be staring back at the camera. Many were suprised and shocked at the sight and many conspiracy theorist belived it was a alien artifact but scientist found and believed it was an martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. It takes the shape of a face but also unusual shadows made it out to look like an egyptian pharoh when mesa's were more commonly found proving the ""face"" theory uncredible.

At NASA we feel like the ""face"" found on mars is just a natural land mark or a mesa. At NASA we think it is a lava that takes form as an isolated mesa. Although it looks like a face and some theories say it is bona fide evidence of life on mars, we have factual evidence to believe it is a mesa like in the snake river plain in Idaho and also commonly found on Cydonia around where the ""face"" was.

Yes, the landmark resebles a face and shadows make out a eyes, nose and mouth shape to also contribute to the illusion that it could be thought of as proof of aliens or alien civilizations on mars but, there is really no for sure credible evidence that could explain and prove it is an 100% acual bona fide face. It is more likely and more proven to be a simple mesa such as some of the mesa landmarks on earth. Along with the people who feel it is an alien artifact some scientist also believed it was indeed an alien artifact also but sadly it is not altough at NASA we wish we could uncover an Alien civilization on Mars.

In conclusion, this ""face"" is nothing more than a Martian equivilent of a mesa or butte. Although the popular suspition and popularity of it being a ""face on Mars"" it is nothing more than a landform that is also common around the American West. Not only that but, Skeptics and authors felt it would be a good way to attract attention to Mars which could lead to the truth being streched without physicl evidence to back up their theories.",3
046efe7,"I belive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it is not possible for people to live on Mars, there are no such thing as aliens, and why would there just be a head shape object and not the rest of the body. In the passage it says, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Also how could there be life on Mars. Mars has no oxygen so people can breathe. All NASA wanted to do was ,"" engage public and attract attention to Mars."" also in the text it states that NASA said,"" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shodows giving the illusionb of eues, nose and mouth.""

The Face on Mars is not real because it is just a natural landform caused by erosion and broken rocks. An example from the text is, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.""

Secondly another reason the Face is a nautural landfrom is because it is not possible for people to live on Mars. Studies have shown that there is no oxygen on Mars and people can not breathe there. Also the preasure of the gravity on Mars would be too much for a human and could crush their bones and musles. Thirdly, why would the rest of the body not be with the Face. That proves that the Face is just a natural landfrom create by erosion and rocks because if the Face was there on the ground why wouldnt the rest of the body by with the Face.

In conclusion the face is just a natural landfrom becuase NASA have send rovers up to Mars to take pictures of the Face and NASA said themselves,""when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. So that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Also in the text it states,"" New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.""        ",3
047a377,"The use of technology suchas, Facial Action Coding system, is totally uneccessary in the classroom setting. Claiming that "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' "" is an ineffective way to to really, truly get through to the students. Instead of focusing on adding more technology to the classroom, maybe giving teachers a better salary and better education would help the teachers teach better, then the students would understand the material better. In the article, it says "" we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day"". If humans already have this natural ability, then adding more technology into the classroom that teacher could already be doing, is uneccessary and distracting. I am sure there are some upsides to this, but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy. In the article is says "" ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucor' ""

The teacher can not just modify an entire lesson because one student is confused, that is unfair to the students that understand the lesson already. Instead, the teacher could work with the student individually and help them with what they are having trouble with.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can druve themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us but we grow closer to the destination every day.Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless can to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream.

Driverless cars might be a good idea for long road trips, but just think about how much work those cars would need if they broke down.

On the positive side these driverless car might be a good idea for someone that's always is on the go & they get tired of driving. It may also be good for the mothers of young children. Only when the child is crying the can have the car driving it's self while they get the baby in order. They should really make that a feature of the car. Other than that the car seems worthless & is just another car problem that us Americans would have.

Then we have the negative & I could go on & on about this one. Now having a driverless is just insane & lazy. First off what is the point of having a car if it's just going to drive it's self? I think it would cause more accident & like the article said; who's fault would it be the would the accident be on? Then insurance would be at an all time high, because the makers of these cars are going to find everyway to make these more advanced then the next, like I said in the first paragraph how much EXACTLY would it cost to buy A car like this or even fix a car like this ? Literally us as people only make enough to support our families & pay the bill. Having to buy these cars would be another thing to break us.

To wrap things up, in my opinion i think this car is something that they should second guess. It might benefit some people & others it might put a steep hole in their pocket. Once again i feel as if there is no purpose of having a car if you're not going to drive it.",3

Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and polution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care alot about making and having alot of benjamins (

money

). Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our polution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country. I know it will change it and make it better!               ",4

The object looks like something kids need in there life to learn someting new. That will motivate them for them to do great things and try to invent other things. I just writing what I know how to right this doen't really matter because imma fail anyways but this story wouldn't really valuable why because I know our generation and if we have it in our school no one would care. I wouldn't here one person say ""hey lets check out the FAC"" because I know what im saying I would like to speak the truth.

499982,"My position on driverless cars is that I am a against the development of these cars. My three reasons why I don't agree with this is because they don't do all the driving, not all drivers will be paying attiontion, and people won't need to get a lissions or need there permit and it will break the cartural of driving.

The car dosn't drive all by itself you will to take over if there is work zones or if there is accidents. Since it dosn't drive on work zones or by acciedents how would you knowif there is one? What if you sleeping? If your going on a high way and your sleeping on a long road trip and there is an accendent ahead of you or there is work zones you wouldn't possable know and you will be ending up in a accedent.

This leads to my second reason that not all drivers will be paying attintion on the road since the car will be driving by it self they won't no need to be looking at the road. They will be busy on there phone or be sleeping. This will cause alot of increase of accidents if diviers don't payattintion while the car is driving. Also it will increase alot of accidents in teens since they will be on there phone and wouln't care whats going on.

My last reson is that people won't need a permit or a lissions anymore.This could be dangrous. Since the car is going to be doing all the work there isn't a point of passing the permit test if your not taking the wheel, or the lisson test of driving the car because your not going to be driving its the car. This will affect us because we never know the people out there and can't trust them all.

This is why I dissagree in the driverless cars. This will affect us and cause more accidents and people won't be paying atintion.This is why I dont think agree with this.   ",3
04a4399,"The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools to help students. There are benefits to this system, but the bad outweigh the good. This technology used to reconize emotions will affect students in ways that aren't necessary, and cause unwanted problems in the classroom.

Firstly, the article metions this system being used on computers while students are working to analyze their emotions. The author writes "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (Alto 6). Having a computer watch students' facial expressions while working could make the students feel uncomfortable and give them anxiety. Being uncomfortable while working will effect the way a student learns. They will not be focusuing on the material they are learning, but instead the idea that they are being watched. This is a problem that's not needed in the classroom and can be avoided.

Secondly there are tons and tons of emotions a human can express. The author writes "" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (Alto 3). Having only classified six emotions, is not a very wide range. What if for example, a student were to show an emotion that the computer doesn't have programmed and reconizes it as somthing else, changing the lesson to fit the wrong emotion? This would cause the lesson to be changed when the student didn't need it to be. This creates a technology problem along with the problem of fixing the lesson and wasting time the student could be using to learn.

Lastly, having a computer analize a students emotions while working would leave the teacher with nothing to teach or help the students with. This might seem like a good thing at first, but teachers create the classroom atmosphere and keep students ingaged in learning. Why have a computer analyze student emotions when teachers have been doing it perfectly for years?

The Facial Action Coding System is a great advance in technology, but when it comes to schools, the System should not be used. It only creates problems that are not needed. These problems could be avoided by not using the system.",4

04a99cb,"""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""

Dear Senator I strongly suggest you on changing to election by popular vote and getting rid of the Electoral College. As you can see on the quote above people really don't like the Electoral College. This would be a very wise decision because the Electoral College is very old and unfair and it cause many crisis to happened.

First and foremost the Electoral College is very old.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is getting old and unfair so we should start fresh with a new change from electoral college to popular vote. Also the electoral college sometimes causes many crisis.

It states in the article "" The single best argument against the electoral college is that we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows for much worse.""

This quote explains how the electoral college caused a fiasco in 2000 because of the electoral college and if we don't get rid of it we could have another one of these crisis.

On the other hand the electoral college should not be taken away because our founding fathers established it.

It states in the article ""Source 1: What is the Electoral College?"" ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

This quote illustrates how the electoral college is suppose to help us and noy hurt us. Also our founding fathers established so they were just trying to get everything in order and have peace with everyone.

Although the electoral college is very unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""At the most basic level, the electoral coolege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on only the tight race in the ""swing"" states.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is unfair and doesn't give chances to other states that supposively have no chance on voting for that certain canditate.

All in all Senator the electoral college must be abolish. Not only does it create many disasters, but it is very unfair to us citizens. The electoral college is very old and we should give a break. We could start with something fresh like the popular vote and see how it turns out. As you can see there is many evidence on how the electoral college is bad and that you should give the popular vote a chance.    ",3

04af97d,"Driverless should not be used under any condition. Driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. We should never risk ourselves or others just because we are lazy and dont wanna drive. If we left everything to these driverless cars many pepole could die. Driverless cars should not be allowed on the streets.

To begin, Driverless are carless. Driverless cars can not stay allert like a human can. In the passage it states, ""They can steer, accerlate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". This shows that a Driverless cars just does not have what it takes to be out on the road. If a kid ran in the middle of the street, unsuspectingly, the car would not have time for the human to take over and the kid would be severly injured or worse. It just is not worth the risk.

In addition, Driverless cars are not advanced enough. Driverless cars may have sensors and take extra steps in safty but technology just is not there. The pasage says, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". In the future we may have the power we need to have driverless cars, but in this time now we do not. Many states even have laws that will not allow driverless cars to even be tested in that states.

Finally, They are not reliable. All technology has flaws and that can not be helped. The passage even states, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver ot the owner?"". This is a good point, The car technology may seem flawless, but many factors come into play with something this big. The car may have a maulfunction that no one could have predicted, and many pepole could be injured or killed. This driverless car just is not reliable enough to risk the lives of innocent.

Driverless cars are a very nice idea and would be helpful, However driverless cars just are not safe. These driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. Many factors play in even ones we can not fully predict when it comes to technology. Its not worth the risk of pepole getting hurt just because we get lazy and do not want to drive. Theres no way to avoid it; its just safer to relie on ourselves instead of a robot.",4
04b354e,"Walking into the voting booth ""...every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November"" (Office Of Federal Register 6), the people of the United States of America expect their vote to count. Although, the president is elected in a more indirect way, by the electoral college, which does not represent the people, and is not fair. The president should be elected by popular vote from now on.

The first problem that the electoral college faces is the fact that it does not truly represent the opinion of the people. First, voters can walk into the booth and ""...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is ""rare"";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.

Looking deeper into the subject, elections by the electoral college are not fair. The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.."" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors. Another issue with a tie in the electoral college lies in how that draw is resolved. The  tie-breaker is left to the representatives in congress, and ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming...would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California..."" (Plumer 12). This simply does not give all the voters equal say in who wins the election. All of these topics and more compressed together represent how un fair the election truly is.

Entering the booth next election day, dont only think about who you are voting for, but also how you are voting for them. It makes all the difference, and, ultimately, the popular way is the best way.    ",5
04b4ad6,"""Out travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers or doubt"" The author of this article belives that it's worthy to study Venus no matter the dangers we could be face to face with.

In the article the author states we should travel beyond despite all the dangers we could come across. This author supports his idea by stateing that we could go beyond our imagination and innovation. NASA is working on sending humans to go and study up closely Venus. I think we should study different planets only if we are not faced with any danger in our way, this way we know if most of the planets are survivable.

In the article the author states if and when we arrive to Venus it could be tough desicion and with unease conditions but it could be survivable for humans. Radiation would be one of the dangers we would have to face. Another aspect that would make the conditions on Venus uneasy would be the fact that air pressure could get us really ill if and when we travel there.

In my opinion i think the opportunitiy of traveling to any other planet such as our neighbors Mars and Venus are a great way to go above and beyond out of our planet. This would be such a great opportunity

for us to travel to different planets, then again if we dont come acroos any dangers.

This would be a great exploration for us to send humans to study other planets as the author states and when we do, we will know what we are up againist.      ",3

When they scanned Mona Lisa's face she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry.

Now if people start turnning towards this method of telling how people feel instead of asking them to make them feel better then you are shutting yourself off from society and that's not okay. If you want to now how someone feels don't make a 3-D model of their face to have a computer tell you just go up and ask them how they feel and what will make them feel better. It amazes you when you find out how many people turn towards technology instead of face to face converstations.

Fianally if you scan someones face to see if you can make them feel better than you are doing it all wrong. You need to walk up to that person and say ""Are you okay, what do you need to help you"". Also when you do scan someones face they can put on whats called a ""Fake Smile"" and trick the computer into thinking it's a actual smile, so it will say they are happy when in reality you are mad or upset.

04bc9b6,"Face On Mars

Have you ever wondered if there was possibly other life forms out there, living on other planets? In 1976, NASA'S spacecraft ""Viking 1"" was circling Mars and taking photos. Suddenly, it spotted a form that almost looked like a human face. Some conspiracy theorists assume and consider it to be evidence of other life forms, while NASA knows it's just another landform on Mars. It's common to have forms like that around Cydonia, it's also proven that there is no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually show that it's a martian similar to land forms here on Earth. All the evidence NASA has brought upon us has proven that it is just another land form on Mars.

Firstly, it is common around Cydonia to have land forms as such. NASA

has taken plenty of pictures of Mars to know that it's quite common for there to be land forms like this. Although it may have unusual shadows, NASA could only wish that there would be possible evidence of ancient civilization on Mars. It being common, creates a slimmer chance of it being crafted by other life forms.

However, when Mars Global surveyor in April 5, 1998, Michael Malin was able to snap pictures with his Mars Orbiter Camera team. These pictures were much more clear. When the image was first revealed on a JPL web site, they realized it was only a natural landform. There was no alien monument to be seen. This strong evidence shows that with a clear image, there is no sign of any alien monument.

Furthermore, the pictures show that it's a Martian equal to a butte or mesa lanforms, seen around the American West. This evidence clearly shows that it's related to Earth land forms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. This Earth landform is only a lava dome. The height is similar to the height to the face on Mars. These landforms being equal, show that it's normal to have land forms such as the Face on Mars.

But, perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze, and there could be possible evidence that aliens are indeed out there. Maybe a closer look into the image would clearify these statements. However, as likely as it sounds, the pictures taken were accurate, with an advanced camera.

Nevertheless, the chances of this Face on Mars being created by aliens is proven false. NASA

may hope that someday they might discover evidence of other life forms. Until then, they have supporting explanations on why it's not. For it to be common to have land forms like the Face on Mars, gives enough clearification. As well as, there being no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually showing a land form similar to ones on Earth. We never know what the future holds, so will NASA ever discover facts that support the conclusion of there being life on other planets?    ",4
04c4f26,"Dear,state senator

The Electoral College voting method is a very debated subject among the people. That is why I am here to explain to you my opinion on it, and why i think that the whole process needs to be stopped. As you can probably already tell, I completely dis like the whole process all together but anyway here is my letter to you.

The first issue with this process is that there is not that much stability to it. When people vote for who they want as president they're giving their votes to some one else just so the person they gave them to can vote for who they want to,not for the elector that that person actually put down on the ballet. We the people are not even the ones who technically get to pick who we want as president, it's the electors.

This being said brings me to my next point,what is the point of the people voting if we arent even the ones who get to pick the representatives? Yes, they say that when people are voting,they are actually voting for electors but what if the electors dont listen to the peoples votes and only vote for who they want? It is true that the slate of electors is trusted to vote for the parties person they want to elect but, there is always that tiny percentage that the electors can break that trust. When they take these chances they are setting themselves up for disaster.

I hope that you take what I said into consideration. These are just a few of the things that are wrong with the Electoral College system. Its only a matter of time before people like me start to realize everything wrong with the system we have now, and when they do realize the things wrong with it, they will want something done about it. Please help get a better system going and end this Electoral College crap we have now.            ",3

They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when theroad ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" If these cars were really driverless, they wouldn't need a driver to help them navigate. Are these cars really driverless? No.

Are these cars going to run on gas or electricity? Either way, these cars not start. A car stalls all the time, but those cars we handle, but what about cars that are driverless? Would we know how to fix it or would we have to spend hundreds to get it fixed? These cars will cost hundreds to get fixed over and over again. Who wants to do that? I wouldn't mind having to charge it but then my electricity bill will be over the top expensive.

Would our kids be safe to be in the cars? What happens if our kids are playing and the car starts and the kid gets hurt or even dies? Would it be your fault or the car producers?

04d13e6,"Having a driverless car may be the gretest or the worst thing someone could have. I am not against on driverless cars because they can be safe, prevent texting and driving accidents, and they alert you when you need to take control of the car. Not only because they drive themselves mean that they are amazing, it can just help to prevent accidents more often.

Driverless cars may be safer than an actual person driving. A mother may have to give the bottle to the baby because it won't stop crying and the car can take care of driving while the mother feeds the baby. Maybe they are listening to music and are more into the music than into the driving. A driverless car can take care of pressing the brake at the right time to stop before something happens. Also that person may not be in good conditions to drive the car and need to get to a doctor or something. That would be if there isn't something else out there that will have to make you take control of the car.

These driverless cars alert you when you need to take the wheel and control it yourself. It is a good thing becuase they probably know that they can't drive through what is happening. Like said in the passage, their can be a traffic jam or there can be an accident and that would be a reason why the car will alert you. It would be a bad thing that the car wouldn't tell you when to take over because it would just stop working all of the sudden and that would't be good. But what would be good is to prevent you from having a accident while texting.

Many teens and even adults now text while driving. They feel like if they don't respond at that instant moment the world is going to end or something. A driverless car can prevent that becuase it can be driving itself and you could answer a call or a text and then get back to driving. The car can prevent you from having an accident from not paying attention to the road. Also maybe you can't find your phone and it keeps on rinigng and it distracts you so the car can take care of the driving while you search for the phone.

In conclusion having a driverless car can be a great thing because you can respond an emergency text without having a fear of dying, it can be safe for you and passengers, and it alerts you when you need to take control. It can be a good thing for the future because more and more technology comes out each year and we are always amazed by everything we see.  ",3
04d2b73,"Do you really need a computer to express your emotions? Updates in technology have found ways for a computer to track facial movements to detect human emotion. This allows computers to detect your emotions before you do. We are told to answer if this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that this techonlogy is not valuable in a classroom.

My first reason for thinking its not valuable is because it doesn't provide any benefits to the classroom. Why does our expression or emotion need to be known by the teacher or computer? Education doesn't have to be amusing or easy. Thats the point of learning. Emotion isn't taken in to consideration when we are assigned homework.

Secondly, my reason for disagreeing with the valuability of this technology in a classroom is because looks are decieving. Let's say for example a stuent is doing perfectly well on their assessment and sees how much time has gone by. They are confused, but only for a second. This is sent to the instructor as a message of confusion on the topic. This has caused an unnessisary interuption on the assesment. Computers can't detect every emotion, and they surely can't detect where the cause of that emotion is coming from.

In contrast to my argument, one could say that for a computer, being able to tell emotions gives us an davantage. For example ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" as quoted in paragraph 6. I would argue that if a student is becoming confused then they should ask questions. Also, it is natural to not take interest in the lesson. Boredom is commom in school, but that should not impact the ability to learn.

In conclusion, the technology provides no real benefits to a classroom, neither to a student. Bringing this technology to a classroom would be a waste of time. Emotions are decieving in school and don't have to be acknowledged by a computer. This is why I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.",4
04d3f9c,"Venus is worthy pursit despite the damage it presents. Venus is worthy pursit despite the damage it presents because it was once the earths like planet in the solar system. Another reason is because Venus was once covered by oceans. The last reason is because they want to understand why no spaceship has ever made it to Venus to actually try to get samples and other stuff to study it.

Venus was once the earths like plante in the solar system. Scientists want to study venuse even though it dangers to see why its not like it use to be. The old venus was just like earth years ago but then it started changing with the years. In the passage it said that "" Astronomers are fascinatesx by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earths-like planet in out solar system"" (Paragraph 4, Sentence 2). This means that they are really into the thing that Venus was once like Earth. They want to keep studying it until they have something to compareit to Earth with.

Venus was once covered by oceans years ago. Another reason why sciantists want to study Venus is because Venus was once covered with bodies of water and want to see why that changed. In the passage it said that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (paragraph 4, sentence 3). This means that they are really fasinated by the way that Venus just went from being bodies of water to having eruptions of volcanoes all the time and earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All these stuff have changed Venus completly and they want to figure out why.

Scientists want to understand why not one single spaceship has made it to Venus without falling apart. In the passage it says that "" Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" (Passage 2, Sentance 6). This means that they have not been able to make any spaceship land on Venus. Maybe it could be the 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus has or the acid in the atmosphere that Venus has. All the spaceships have not survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is also working on other stuff so they can approach Venus such as electronics made of silicon carbide and has lasted for three weeks.

In conclusion people think that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. One reason for that is because it was once the earths like planet in the solar system. Another reason is because Venus was once covered by oceans. The last reason is because they want to understand why no spaceship has ever made it to Venus to actually try to get samples and other stuff to study it.      ",4
04d409d,"Having driverless cars into our life is one less problem that we have to worry about in our daily life. It will help our life get so much easier, because you might not have to worry about fuel prices or driving to places when you're tired. Also it will help reduce the number of teenage's death, because most of the death of teen are cause by car crashed. It's good for those who travel a lot, because as a driver you don't have to drive all the way to the destination. By having Driverless Cars into our life, it'll save money, help reduce the cause of teenage death and it help to drive for you when you're tired and need to take a rest for a bit.

First of all, I think it's a great idea to have driverless car, because it helps reduced the death of teen. In American, almost most of the death of teenager are caused by texting while driving. Although many organizations tried to tell teenager to ""Stop Texting while Driving"", it is not effective, because in these day more teen are being pressure by technology whether it is in TV or Internet and they want to be cool. That's why having Driver less can help reduced the death rate. For example, if you're driving and text message pops up, you can let the car drive by itself and text. In paragraph 2, it said that the cars have been driven more than a million miles without a crash which mean that teens and young adult can let the car drive for a couple hours and text which can save their life. Not only does it can help reduced the car crash rate, it can also help you save money.

""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than bus."" If they do succeed on letting driverless car legal, it would help individual so much. Traveling is fun things but nowaday not many people travel or goes to roadtrip anymore because one of the main problem is that they don't have the expenses to paid for the fuel or spending too much on fuel can decrease the amount of money they can save. If they do secceeded on having the driverless car and the fuel cost less to use it, then it would be great for many people. More people will be able to save money. Not only that, it will greatly help with the growth of our economy.

Last but not least, the function of the car is beyond our senses, because not only does it drives by itself but it can also elert driver when someting is wrong. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead required human skill"" paragraph 7. In case of emergency whereas the car are not capable of functiong need the driver to take over, it can elert the driver to take over. Also in paragraph 7 it said, ""This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drive's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed drive's seats that vibrate when vehicles is in danger of backing into an object"" So, when it required the drivers to drive, it can vibrate their seat to get their attention. I think it's a great idea to have that in it because it can prevent running into conflicts.

To conclude that having driverless car can help reduced the death of teenagers and young adult. The car can take over when people need to text or make a phone call, and it can drive for you when you're distracted by your surrounding that you can focus on the roads which can help reduced the chance you'll have accident. Not only that, it can help you save money. By spending less in the fuel, you can keep some change in your pocket. Also it can help drive for you when you got to sleep or take a nap if you're in long roadtrips. It support safety for the drivers, whereas the system elert the driver if the car encounter a problem and needed the driver to take over. That's why having driverless car can help our daily life and improved the way we live.",4
04da4bf,"Have you heard about FACS? Its full name is glory is ""the Facial Action Coding System"".It basically allows to tell which emotion the persons feeling. It seems like a great and wonderful device to have in work places and school places! I think we/they should have these devices in places that best need them! Like in and out the classroom.

I think its valuable because when your in a classroom teachers tend to ususally do a lesson even though all the students get bored out of their minds and end up not paying atention!! Same goes for doing a lesson on this computer, the classroom would be able to recognize the students emotions if the school had some of thses devices, but right now we don't because not all schools cant afford new high tech computers to recognize the childrens emotions! In the text it states

""A classroom computer could recognize when a studenr. Hat is becoming cinfused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure! With this it would probably take a while but easy t the same time, because there are so much combinations to this peice of technology! In the text it staes ""he facial expressions for each emotion are univeral,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (Like not smiling as broadly). This tells that there are so many emotions to decode! Now how this works is the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and detects all your muscles in your face to determine what emotion your in. In the text so far states that Eckman has classifed 6 basic emotions and they are; happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Overall, this mechine would be most useful in classrooms because teachers and computer programs can change up so that the students would not be so bored and not pay attention! So they correct their lessons and can make it entertaining and fun for everyone!",3
04db8d6,"We have a Universe full of uncertainties and dangers. Since that is the case, should we just give up trying to discover new things? No, of course not, Then why should Venus be any different. It might be a risky and dangerous job but, this might also be a golden opportunity to, maybe find out connections between Venus and our Earth.

Astonomers believe that Venus used to be an Earth-like planet long ago. There are actual some features now on Venus that resmbles to Earth wiith familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and even craters. Furthermore, let us not forget the fact that Venus also sometimes is our nearest option for a plantery visit. That should be more than enough reason to try and study more of Venus. One day we might need that information, so better safe then sorry.

Lastly, even though is will be difficult scientist are already figuring out safer options to study Venus, like hovering over the planet to gather intel without a real big risk. And even getting electronics tested for Venus's harsh climate. It might be difficult but, where would we be if we just gave up trying to discover new things when things get tough.                 ",3
04dbd25,"Limiting car usage could come off as absurd to some people. They ask ""Why would I reduce my use of something that gets me to my desired destination the fastest?"" Despite the fact that cars appear to be more conveinient, the harm they do to the Earth far outweighs the benefits. Cars have become more and more prevelant in the entire world since World War II, as society has been built around the car and its ease of use. This unremitting usage of the car has resulted in a shocking amount of pollution to the Earth. The reduction of car usage is advantageous to the environment. Cars produce so much pollution, have a gradual decuction in use would have possitive effects on the environment.

The greatest advantage of limiting car usage is the positive effects it would have on the environment. It is common knowldge that the Earth is in a state of self-destruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmuful emissions come from cars and other gas-powered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of grenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the  United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environemnt that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article ""The End of Car Culture."" The article states that a limit to car usage would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions."" This article does not only say that cars are  large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.

Despite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous.                    ",4
04defeb,"Many people believe that this face on Mars was made by an Ancient Alian Race that once lived on Mars. This Face was discivered 25 Years ago on a space Expedition. Most NASA scientisis believe that this Face on Mars is a natural land form but, some believe that it is not natural and was formed by Alians. Many Scientists also think against the thought of the formation on Mars being made by an ancient civilization that lived on Mars. Scientists that are against the theory of the face being formed by Alians argue that there are formations on Earth that are also formed how the one on Mars was and that this is natural.

Many Scientisis believe that this is a natural landform because it is like some of the other landforms in the Western United States like the Butte in the Snake River Plain of Ohio. Scientists believe that both of these landforms were created by lava domes because the two formations are around the exact same height and are therefore believed to be created in the same and natural way.

Scientisis have been researching the Face on Mars for years abd have come up with a reasonal explination for why the Face on Mars was not created by Alians and is a natural land formation that is created the same way as some formations in the Western United States. Though Scientists would like to have proof that there was a race of martians that lived thousands of years ago there is logical information prooving that this was a natural formation that is also experienced on Western Regions of the United States.

04df837,"""The challenge of studying Venus"" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. Venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many reasons why it would be so difficult. For some reason though he doesnt really list any benefits to exploring Venus.

Throughout the whole story the author is just making Venus sound like a horrible place. In the article he writes "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to.

Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, "" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. The author writes "" on the planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit."" You cant even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,"" Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans."" All those oceans that may have been their are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth?

In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.",4

I know every show that I have seen, that has to do with driverless cars has proved a big point, and I have learned something I needed to about car safety. But completly driverless cars are a problem. we cant have a car without at least one human looking over it to make sure it stops doing something that it doesnt need to at a reliable time.

Driverless cars are a team thing between technology and men, we have to work togther for it all to work properly.

04e1cec,"Have you ever been really bored of something, but your teacher in class can't tell? The Facial Action Coding system can be enabled on computers that can identify human emotions. There have been many scientists and researchers that are working on this so it can detect your emotions by the muscles in your body. It is kind of like when you are trying to detect a friends emotion because you can tell how they are feeling.

Imagine this a system that can read your emotions based on your facial expressions that is based off of facial muscles. This is something we already kind of do when we try to tell a friends facial expressions. This is something that we humans should be happy to have we hate being bored and a computer would be able to tell that we are, so it would never play that video or ad again which would make it would modify the lesson for each person according to Huang. Also if you really liked that video or ad that was just played they would play simliar ones to it.

Dr. Huang also explains that most communication is non verbal in fact most of our communication is non verbal.

So, what is the Facial Action Coding System you might be thinking. Well the facial action coding system is a computer that constructs a 3d model of each persons face. This must take a while since we do have 44 major muscles in our face. This computer is basically supposed to be able to detect at least the 6 main basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The machine can do so by it can tell the characteristic movements of each facial muscle. The article describes like when you raise your eyebrows you show surpise and when the muscles around your lips it shows anger. This can be benificial in a lot of ways especially when it can tell that you don't like something. Also humans might try to guess facial traits, but we can't describe each facial trait someone has.

Surely you are thinking that a machine can't detect somebodies emotions, but it could detect that the Mona Lisa she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful, and

2% angry. The machine might have some faults at first, but surely if they can make something like that they could improve it. This could be what humans need something or somebody that actually knows how we feel. If that's not convincing if we have psychologists that can detect our emotions based on our smile why can't they help the people coding these machines and get everything right.

In conclusion, is there a machine that can detect our feeling. There could be something or someone that can help in the near future, but currently this is just a project. This is something that could be in the future that will replace our current computers and/ or our smartphones. This is a start to something that could reveal al lot about us, our faces, and our emotions. ",3
04e6cd8,"""The Face""

Have you ever saw something so strange you just had to get a picture of it?! Well if you have, ive done the same! It all started 25 years ago around Mars!

Mission controllers back at the Jet Propulison Lab had to be really suprised of what we have found on Mars. As NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling aound Mars and found a figure similar to a human face, believe me when i say it, Yes a human face!!!Although scientists found out it was just an Martian Mesa, i still find it pretty cool!

A few days after the photo's were taken, NASA has decided to show everyone and let everyone know about this Matian mesa.The caption resembled a human head. The author thought it would be a good idea to attract attention to mars, and it slowly, but surely did!

The human face like structure has became a pop icon, it has appeared in many places and thing such as a film, magazines, talk shows, apppeared in some books, it even made it to the grocery sotre checkout lines ofr 25 years!!That is a really big deal for just a structure on mars!!Certain people thought the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, which is there own opinion.

Global Surveyor as known as (MGS) went ot the Red Planet on September 1997, 18 long years after the Vikings missions ended. On April 5,1998 Michael M. and his Mars Orbiter camerea as known as (MOC) snapped a picture 10 times better then the Vikings!!Also for the first

time, Mars Global Surveyor flow over Cydonia. Come to find out, there was no alien monument after al!But no everyone was satisfied with this photo.

The camera was really bad considering it had to go through wispy clouds just to see the face.Mission controllers prepaired to look at it again.After a while Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a 2nd look on april 8, 200l. What the picture really had shown was a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, they have all been fooled.",2
04ea96d,"presidents are elected every four years. Some presidents make changes some presidents don't, society  strongly believes any president elected should make good changes. Any citizen from any state want's the president elected to make a difference, thats clearly one of the presidens duites. Presidents sometimes do not compensate for the mistakes they make that they're not supposed to make. Citizens votes should be the votes counted for electing presidents and not couted for electing electors.

To begin with, most presidnets elected most of the time make no difference and citizens are not content. Presidents have many duties to complete and of them is to make changes and make the world a better place for all citizens. in the article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner he states ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" what the author clearly states is that society is not voting for a presidential candidate but for a slate of electors. This is why most of the time society is not content with the president chosen and bad changes are made. Citizens are the ones who live in this country so they should be the one's who's votes are counted for electing presidents so that they do not suffer the next four years.

To continue, some presidential candidates intentions to society are harmful and do not help them in anyway possible. Presidents intentions while on their four years of being presidents are supposed to help society and make their life easier and not worse. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer he states ""can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Somtimes."" this quote shows that not only is society not voting for the presidential candidate they are in favor of but they cant even control who their electors vote for sometimes. Citizens in anyway possible can not vote for the presidential candidate they are in favor of so that means society will not be content for four years and changes will be made that will make their lifes harder and some priveliges will be taken away if the presidents intentions are not helpful. Society will be living in hell in other words.

It's every fun, it allowed me to go on adventures and vist unique places like Greece, Venice, Italy, and I even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are also others things to do besides go to different places when you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Even though you get free time there is also work to do. When my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I just couldn't say no, I knew it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime. Let me give you some reason on why you should join.

Like i said before there are others things you have to do when participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One thing is you have to take care animals. Everytime I found it fun taking care of the animals, especially on when I returned from trips and the animals had been unloaded. There were different types of animals on board like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea. Once there was even a cargo with 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

My next reason is you also get to play games on the ship. The cowboys and I played baseball, volleyball games, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. These games helped us pass time when we didnt have work to do. Sometimes we would even play games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would even have different types of tournaments.

The most important and my last reason is that while in the Seagoing Cowboys we had to help different people with things. We had to help them with animals, food, and we had to help on the ship. There were many things we had to do on the ship like be watchmen, check the animals every hour, and make an hourly report to the captain. There is a lot of work you have to put in into being a Seagoing Cowboys even if you do get hurt. But it will be all worth it in the end.

I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It was very fun for me, so if i had fun being one then I feel like you will to. You will have a lot of fun trust me. ",3
04ef8ff,"After reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it made me inclined to think that a driverless car would be a benefical thing to have. They could potentally reduce driver made accidents and make the roads run safer and smoother than they do today.

Some people may believe that driverless cars are dangerous, but they may not realize that safety is one of the major concerns that manufacturers have. They still plan on having the driver maintain alert and ready to take control of the car if needed. In paragraph 7, the writing states that, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This leads me to believe that these cars are safe.

There are still some issues involving the driverless cars. Such as figuring out who is at fault if there is an accident. Would the driver in the car or would the manufacturer of the car be held responsible? These are good questions, but the writing says that, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Which means that chances are the laws will change and the people will decide what the future laws of the driverless cars will be.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless cars are going to be made no matter what. The car manufacturers are continuing to make imporvements to the cars sensors and computers everyday. The article even says that, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" So, driverless cars are going to happen, and they are going to happen soon.",3

04f47a5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author includes many benefits and dangers that come with exploring Venus. Venus is known for its uninhabitable atmosphere and environment, but scientists believe that long ago Venus was the planet most similar to Earth. In this article, the author believes that humans should go beyond the limits of dangers and supports his or her idea well with inspiring points that motivate anyone to look past the boundaries. The author lists the extreme dangers of Venus, and then answers why scientists are so set on exploring it.

The author first regards the dangers of Venus. The author explains the problem to finish with a promising solution. The author gives dreadful facts that prove the planet is extremely inhospitable for any human and even some space crafts. The author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" The author does not say this to frighten anyone but to blunty state what the NASA scientists are up against.

Further into the article, the author answers the important question ""why?"" Why would anyone want to put themselves at these risks? Why is Venus worth all of the trouble? The answer is, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author wants people to realize that Venus has the potential to be almost identical to Earth, but the author also includes that scientists cannot be certain without further exploration. The potential of Venus being another part of our world is certainly going to excite many astronaunts and explorers to go make it certain.

Venus has the potential to hold an exciting new world, but the dangers astronaunts and scientists must face are lethal. The author paints a new possibility in this article by describing the potential Venus could hold. This article clearly shows how the author informs about the dangers of Venus but then answers why the scientists are to eager to get to know this planets. With the way the author gives inspiring points about exploring this planet, anyone can look past the dangers and see a new world.  ",4

Driverless cars are for the lazy people, they're for people who don't wanna drive they just want to sit back and let the car drive for them. If that was the case they wouldn't have gotten their license to drive. In the future licenses wouldn't be a thing if driverless cars are around , there's no need for one if the car just lets you sit there and watch it drive every where,that's just wasted time to get your permit then wait a few months and then get your license for driving.

Before putting any real driverless cars into the real world they should round alot of tests , because they should want everything perfect no messups or anything because that can be very dangerous if the cars system isn't programmed right or anything .

If you believe that the nearly two mile formation was staring back at the cameras was a face, the main reason this formation could not possibly be a formation of a face created by another life form on a different planet is because there is no scientific evidence of aliens to be discovered.

The Face has recieved national recognition as being a representative for most pop icons, Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. But because the Face is a popular icon, the way the face is portrayed to have been created and used for has been taken out of context by audiences around the world. Spin-off series about the Face and aliens have promoted the idea that aliens are real, although there is no scientific evidence to be found. The media that used the Face has promoted audiences to believe that the Face is actually a formation made by aliens, as a way to keep their audiences interested and to make more incom by their audiences believing their predictions of aliens.

As a result of the majority of people believing that the Face was an alien artifact, NASA decided to fly over the formation again to take a new picture using an updated camera that was ten times sharper than the camera used originally to take the first pictures, in order to investigate if he formation was really made and occupied by an alien life form. The new pictures concluded that

what seemed to be an alien life form was actually just an actual landform. Yes, there may be different and unusual kinds of makrings on the land form because it is located on a different planet where there are different conditions occurring.

What has now been proven to show that the Face is a natual landform is that the landform is the Martian equivalent of a buttle, which are landforms common around the American West.

Whether you believe or don't believe that the landform on the Red Planet is made by aliens, there is more authentic evidence that is relevent to showing that the landform is just a natural occurrence, rather than evidence presented by science fiction enthusiasts. Although the formation may seem to have the appearance of a face, there are also many natural objects on Earth that have the appearances of faces too. So, making assumptions because of a conspiracist's predictions does not automatically make your assumption correct.   ",4
0502b23,"Technology in the classroom has always been a great idea, it allows for students to find information quicker, keep all their assignments in one place. But now it could be used to interpret the emotions of students. This technology could be used to detect how students are feeling about a teachers teaching style; this software could also detect if a student is bored or confused, and even if they are sad or angry.

Using this technology can help determine what is neccesary in keeping a classroom engaged and happy. But students may not want a machine reading their emotions at all times in a classroom, say that a student has lost a loved one and doesn't want that to be public to the faculty at the school because he might be treated diffrent. The technology could detect his sadness and the teacher may try to comfort him, or tell other teachers about the way he feels. But for the greater good of possibly detecting depressed or suicidal students may out weigh the bad that the technology may produce. I am for this type of technology in the classroom, its benifits out weigh its fallbacks, other than possibly being inaccurate due to displaying false emotions.

The use of emotional recognition software in the classroom is a great idea to keep students in the minds of their teachers and truely help them create an environment that is catered to the happiness of their students. Lets not forget how useful it will be to detect if students are actually learning in the classroom. And probaly most importantly to detect students who may be a threat to themselves or others.",3
0509d92,"In addition to, the story people think that the Face was created by aliens. In this essay i will be talking about, Whether or not people have proof or evidence that the Face was created by aliens?, What would make people think that the Face was created by aliens?, and How do you think this if you just found out about the Face?.

With that being said, Do you think these people that thought the Face was created by aliens have proof or any type of evidence?... I don't think they had proof or any type of evidence because it was on Mars people csn not go around assuming that it was created by aliens if they have no proof. People would have to go to Mars and see for theirselves. Just because it was founded on Mars doesn't neccesarly means that it was created by aliens.

Next, What makes people think that the Face was created by aliens?. Is it because they knew that it came from Mars?... I strongly believe it is because all these people knew that it came from Mars, i'll tell you why i think this. I think this because it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stores as stated in paragraph 5. So, because it appeared in so many places people started to make assumtions, and really believed that the Face was created and made by aliens.

Futhermore, How does people think this if they just recently found out about the Face?. Well, people think this just because it it was the most popular story or myth going on at the time and since it came from Mars that it was created by aliens because they know people doesn't live on Mars.. But, that doesn't mean human beings do not visit to see what it is like in person.

In my opinion, last but not least, people should not make any assumtions before they don't know the full story or the truth behind it all and to ask people who was it created it by and stop always thinking they know everything and making a lot of assuming statements, to where it makes a huge rumor around the world.",4
051429c,"In the Article ""The challengle of Exploring Venus""

the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" (para 3.)

The article states, "" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" (para 2) I think the author means by that is humans can not really study Venus's because its in space and no human can go up there too long and study it since its the secong planet next to the sun.

The planet is dangerous because its right by the sun which if you go by the sun you can burn and die from it. The planet's temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

It also has 97 percent carbon dioxide which means the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

In conclusion, I think the author is right. Venus is dangerous and i think NASA should not study it.       ",3
0514ba2,"Is the Electoral College fair and right? This system is composed of the selection of the electors, the meeting of electors, and the counting of congress. This systen includes various methods like the ""winner take all"" system that gives the presidency to the winning candinate of the eletors votes. One very important thing in this system is trust, you have to trust the electors that you voted for to make the right choice. This system of eletor votes is very useful for picking the country's leaders.

The winner take all method is very intresting indeed. The electoral votes decide who wil get what, who will win. Popular vote in no longer in ""session"" or popular, the electoral votes decide it now. For example, in the 2000 election, when Gore had a lot more popular votes than Bush, but Gore had less electoral votes, it was a shocking suprise for the nation, it seemed to be like more people liked Gore than Bush. One very important thing to consider is ... the reason why Bush won, there is a huge diffrence between making a good choice, aka Gore, and and making the right choice, aka Bush!

Trust, its possibliy one of the most hard things to do in life, but in this system its necessary. Its very significant that you put your trust in the slate of people's hands that you and a whole variety of woried people selected. Trust should not just be handed oveer like anything, its should be earned just like respect, vote in the candinate that you trust.

Popular vote is kind of fair in a way because we can all vote like independent citizens.

Sometimes the electoral candinates vote against the people that elected for them and go for what they think is right which in no case is incorrect but a hudreds of citizens were counting on them to make their choice. We all have a voice, we have to use it in the fair way, and the righthous way is mostly a popular vote, but popular vote is not as efficent as eletoral votes.

The Electoral College is right but not fair, althought it has its benifets, its has its defaults as well. In the end we all decide our own fate, but together we must work together to rebuild what has been broken. We must decide on the correct, on the right leader, the leader that will make great choices for us, the leader that will lead this unique, beautiful, and magnificent country to greatness like never befroe seen, and we must be there with that leader every step of the way. Not everyone will expericence greatness but we sure will be part of it!!    ",3

05182bf,"Unmasking the Face on Mars. If I were to be a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks the face was created by aliens. I would prove them wrong, because there are many objects that have some sort of illusion in them. This story tells how the Face is just a simple landform which I believe it is. It's a natural landform because when astronauts were circling around the planet they found it to be a simple landform. Seeing new things that look just like human things can just be an illusion to our eyes, for example the red planet could have had the ""Face"" carved into it.

I think that there are objects that can always fool our minds especially planets. There are certain planets that give us many illusions and we just want to go and figure out why they make us have such an illusion towards nonimportant things. The image of the Face that was spotted in Mars first appeared on a JPL web site, which means that the image was first taken by NASA. I believe that aliens do not exsist still and there could have been no way that the Face was created by one of them. Neil Armstrong was the first astronaut to ever be on the moon and when he came back from the moon he left his steps on the moon. The Face could have been created by someone who has visited Mars (Red Planet) even though the planet almost is the same temperature as the sun they could have taken a pocket knife and began to crave in a human face.

The Face was spotted on Mars, but the certain place that it was spotted was a lava dome, what is a lava dome you may ask?. Well, a lava dome is a place that is isolated from a mesa and can be up the same height as the Face on Mars. There are still some scientist that believe that the Face was someting that aliens created when it could've been a person or even people that wanted to leave a trace left behind. Maybe they left a trace left behind because there probably wasn't anybody who has been there before.

The Face was spotted by NASA and when NASA spotted the face they made sure to zoom in on what looked like Face. I believe that the Face was carved or traced behind due to a human being there, even though they say aliens live in Mars there could be no way that a alien did a cetain thing. Aliens could not have been the ones who left the illusion of a Face because some studies show that aliens were not exsisting at that time. The story also does not state anything towards aliens being on a certain planet especially Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that things you leave on a planet can not always be something a alien did or has done. Our mind has such a great technique to play with our minds, especially if we see things from above like the Face was seen from above. I do believe the Face was just a natural landform. I believe it was just a natural landform because there are some things on planets that have such and illusion into them.",4
519419,"Dear Mr.Senetor,

My name is PROPER_NAME. The Electoral College is a great way to choose the President, but at the same time it isn't because it's not fair for everyone. That is why i believe the Electoral Collge system should be no more.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" It's not only not fair to the voters, but it also isn't fair to the people trying to campaign to be President. Everyone should have the opporitunity to run for President. They may have something meaningful to say and you never know if they actually have the potential to be the President or not if you don't give them a chance.

""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states...Voters in the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing they are going to decide the election."" Yes, the toss-up states like Florida or California are most likely to be more recognized and listened to, but it is not fair to the ""swing"" states. They are just as good as the people who want to be President in the other states, too. Do you think it is fair that a man in Oklahoma is running for President, but no one is paying attention to him because he lives in a state that is rarely mentioned? No! He deserves a chance too!

So in conclusion the Electoral system may be great but, your vote should be counted also. It shouldn't only get to be the electors decision on who gets to be President, but it also shouldn't be based off the more known states. Give other states, ""swing"" states, a chance too. That is why i say the electoral system should be no more.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME                                                                                           ",4
051c46a,"Dear senator,

I have done research and I would like to change the Electoral College to the popular vote for the President of the United States. Source 1: ""What is electoral College?"" explains that ""each canadate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" Many people do not know what that really means. It means that the people of the United States do not actually vote for who their president will be. They are voting for someone who gets to choose who the president will be. Having the Electoral College is very confusing. I think it is more fair to have the people of the United States vote directly for their president instead of voting for a slate of electios that then choose the president.

By getting rid of the Electoral College, the vote for the United States president will be more fair. We, the people of the United States, would not be voting for a slate of electors. We would actually be voting for who we want to become our president. These votes would be more direct and accurate.

Source 2: ""Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states that voters may get confused and vote for someone that they didnt want to vote for. The people should be the ones voting for their president. It is unfair that only the electors get to vote in the end. Voters of the electors cannot even control who the electors vote for. The people have to put their trust in the electors to vote for the president. It make smore sense for the people to have a say and for them to have the ability to vote directly.

When I turn eighteen and I am allowed to vote, I hope that my vote actually matters. I hope that my vote does not just go towards an elector. I hope that my vote will count towards whom I think will represent our country well.            ",3

Cities like Bejing, in China, are heavily polluted by emissions from motor vehicles.  This has negative effects on people's health and the environment.  Another point to be made is that if fewer people are driving cars then you won't have to see cars parked all over your city.  But this is America, not Europe; we like our cars here.  I couldn't stand not being able to drive my Ford Mustang GT whenever i feel like it. That is the problem, people will not want to give up driving their cars.

Simlar structures are on the Earth called mesa and butte usually are seen in the American.

0540b80,"I am personally against the idea of self driving cars. Why you may be asking yourself, am I against an idea that could possibly be revolutionary? Well that's because of how dangerous and irresponsible the whole idea sounds like. We already have enough accidents as it is. Why add more chaos by throwing in cars that can drive themselves? The idea itself is very unrealistic and is just awaiting to be produced to cause trouble.

Firstly, why are we so dependent on technology? Why is it that we create so many inventions to make regular things even better? We should simply be improving where we are going wrong, not distracting ourselves with new toys that have just came out ; figuritevly speaking of course. We rely on electronics so much that most people woudln't be able to function without having a cell phone or a game system.

Now don't get me wrong, some electronics have truly changed the game for us. We can fit loads of data and information on a single piece of metal. We can talk to people across the world, and travel is as good as that as well. Though most of these inventions depend on a human to operate them. Must we create something that doesn't have a rational mindset? Computers don't have emotions the last time I remembered.

The idea is also extremely unsafe. I already mentioned car accidents that may possibly happen, which they will. Though responsible adults are not the only people who drive on roads too. Teenagers who are learning to drive won't even need to know the basics of the road thanks to these self driving monsters! Teens are the most likely to get into car accidnets than any other age group. Just the thought of a young 15 year old on the road, not knowing how to drive an actual car sounds morbid.

The point that I am trying to get across is not only are these cars: unrealistic, unsafe, dangerous, and accident prone; but that they will be the descendent of humanity. Think about it, whenever you drive in a car with friends, family, or just

people in general; people are bonding, communicating, listening to music, or just looking out the window. With phones being extremely popular nowadays, we are slowly losing ourselves with the increase of these productions. Now with these cars, they will change everything. It's a downward fall from that, which is mainly why I am against the whole development of these machines.",4

0545b94,"This Facial Action Coding System is weird. Why would anyone want to know what someone else is feeling or how their emotions are? To me that is personal information that I would want to myself. Plus I doubt that there would be a whoe lot a people who would put money into this to just see what emotion they are. That is just me though. What do you think about this idea? Would you spend time and money on it to just see your emotions and what mood you were in? I wouldn't.

If you keep reading from now on I am going to argue why this is a bad idea, because it is. I mean who would spend any type of time, effort, or money on this just to see what your emotions are or how you are feeling. Honestly who wants to know what facial expressions to use to show that you are happy, I think we already know how to be happy. We dont need a machine to tell us how to look happy. Obviously when someone is happy something great has happened to them or in their lives and they have a great big smile on their face. We also know when someone is mad, obviously when someone is mad they don't like to talk very much, and usually look like they are about to punch you in the face. For example in the text it shows you step by step what expression on your face we need to use to make us look happy, like no I know how to look happy or sad or mad, I don't need a machine to tell me how to do that.

So why do we need a machine to tell us these things when we already know them. Our world is just spending money on useless things and inventing usless things that our world today doesn't need. There is literally no point to the invention. Plus I don't think strangers would want us to calculate their emotions and how they are feeling right now. I mean those things are personal we don't know what their life is like or what they have been through.

To me this is what I am thinking. Is this really what they are spending our money on. The taxes we pay and all the bills we have to pay and they are speding it on these types of silly, usless inventions. Why? Just think, out of the whole world how many of us are going to use this? How many of us have the money to use it? How many of us would think its a great idea? Probably very, very, very few of us in the whole world would use this invention.

That is my take on this Facial Action Coding System. I dont like the idea of it. I think it it useless and would very seldom be used. What do you think? Do you agree with me, or not with me? Would you use it? Would you spend the money on it? Would you want someone to know how you are feeling and the emotions you are going through?",3

When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, it snapped a photo, much clearer than the one obtained by the Viking. When the photo surfaced online, it proved to be nothing but a natural landform. However, some people were not satisfied with this discovery. Conspiracy theorists began to theorize that there were alien markings hidden by haze, which caused for another search to get an even clearer picture, which was not easy.

It is a process the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified cirizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors. Most states use a ''winner-take-all'' method that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The Electoral College is the method we use for voting and selecting our president's.

Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Therefore I think that we should change to a popular vote. Over 50 percent of the people agreee, and I think that should be enough proof. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.

The problem with the electoral college is that you voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, wwho in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate. The slate containing 34 Democratic electors pleged to Kerry. Most likely those voters would probably win the election because Texas is a big state and a high percentage of the people voted Kerry.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Just as Romney was a solid regional in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states. This causes the method to be difficult to chose a for sure winner. Usually elections are always close.

The Electoral College restores some of that weight in the pollitical balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The method may turn off potential voters. Especially for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California. I think that we should changeb to a popular vote method. Either way, people should be encouraged to vote because every vote counts.    ",3
55800,"There are many questions about the mystery of the ""Face on Mars."" The article states that the picture of the Face is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" More information about the ""Face on Mars"" is in the following statements.

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence. ",3
05592d5,"People over the years that have been talking about cars that drive themselves have found this topic very interesting because of the phrase"" Cars that drive themselves"". Yes it sounds interesting and very cool and far into the future but there are downsides to this idea and there are some good sides. It depends on the people that you ask because some could say oh no way! Then there are some that could say oh yes way! Then you have to think of it this way, are these futuristic cars even safe for humans to be in?

Driverless cars do sound really cool to me because then you don't really need to do anything but sit back and watch. Then again I just don't think that I would want a car that drives itself only because of the dangers it kind of puts you in. For example, in the passage it states that these cars have all of these sensors on it that can keep you safe while you're driving it, well what do you do if while that car is driving and one of the sensors malfunctions and there is a car running a stop sign while it's your turn to go what do you do? You won't even see the car coming from the side of you and that sensor malfunctioned so it can't alert the car then you get smacked into by the other vehicle. These cars do come with very dangerous factors and possibilities that can happen at any given moment. So yes these cars are cool but I would never get one for myself.

In paragraph two when it talks about how television and movies have been fascinated with cars that drive themselves, I think it can be a bad thing for them doing that. That's because the way movies and TV portray the driverless cars is so unreal but others who don't understand that well, they could be in a good amount of danger. For example in the movie Transformers, every single one of those cars drive themselves. They steer themselves, they can open their own doors, they can do all of this stuff and someone who actually believes that that is what these manufacturers are coming out with, then they are wrong because they think that it will be able to do that stuff and while they're distracted BOOM! They just got t- boned by another driver because the person wasn't paying attention. These cars could really cause a lot of danger to society.

Driverless cars are way too dangerous to me, I feel like people would be irrisponsible with them and cause harm to the community. I'm against cars that drive themselves for right now until they can proove to me that these cars are 100% safe. Like we all know today there are crazy drivers out thtere and with them on the road with a car like this, that could put a ton of people in danger. To help prove my whole point in paragraph 9 it says that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer""? Well here is the thing, it said if the technology fails. That means that there is a chance of the technology failing and causing harm, just like a lot of other technology can do. For example, some sort of saw to cut wood or metal. If one of those things malfunctions and a blade goes flying it could hit someone and easily kill them. Not all technology is 100% fool proof so that is why I wouldn't trust this driverless car.

So once again I do not support the creation of one of these driverless vehicles because of a safety issue. Even if this car does have all of these sensors on it that doesn't mean that it is totally safe because you still have all of these other crazy drivers on the road that could potentially smack into if they aren't paying attention or even if you aren't paying attention. Yes in the movies these cars do look really cool but I don't think that they need to be created and brought into real life. I say that we just stick to what we already do. That's having actual people drive the car instead of having a computer programmed into the car driving it. Now I know people don't drive 100% either but what if the technology fails and someone dies in a crash? Then what do you do? You definitely can't blame the person for something that a company made malfunctioning. We the people just need to stop and think about what all could happen if you let a computer drive your two to three ton vehicle.                          ",5
056394c,"What is your opinion on smart cars? Would they help or just create future issues that were worse than before? I personaly support the current movement on smart cars. If the technology improves enough to cover all the current issues then I believe smart cars could really help alot. They would decrease accidents and allow people to use valuable time driving to do other things like learn or invent. Im standing in neutral ground though on weather they should be completely driverless unless they improve the smart cars in a way to make them completely safe.

To fully support smart cars and turn the publics opinion on supporting them I belive they need to create new laws that would clearly state whos resbonsible if an accident does accur. I think this because who would want to buy a car that you dont have to drive, but if the car does get into an accident your resbonsible! That would be a big problem and would creat problems between individuals and car manufacturers. The question being whos resbonsible?

Another thing they would have to improve would be their sensing technology. They would have to improve this because currently if their is an accident or detour they driver has to take over. If they want to make driverless cars then they should be driverless at all times. Would you agree? If the driver is being entertained and watching movies then suddenly after hours of watching movies he has to be completely focuse and in control of the vehicle wouldnt the person be a little tired and not completely focused? Im not totaly for sure how they could fix this problem, but im sure it will raise questions in the near future. Seeing how they want to push the people into supporting smart cars they would have to fix all issues and cover all the corners.

All of these small improvement would, in my opinion, turn the publics eyes into supporting smart cars. Getting the public to support smart cars would be one of the most important things to do if they want smart cars to be a success. If nobody supports them then all the work they are doing would be useless. Support would also put thme in a better financial spot. Having more money to put into smart cars would mean better and more improved research and development.

If all of the issues I brought up could be worked on and improved then, in my opinion, their would be no reasoning for people and myself for not supporting smart cars. Hopefully i'v coverd some of the current issues with smart cars and once their improved you will be like me and support the ever so growing idea of smart driverless vehicles.This is my opinion on smart cars. As long as they can continue to improve and come out with new ideas I fully support the movement on smart driverless automobiles!",4
056a4a4,"Everyone today believes that having a car is the best thing for them. Truthfully, it is not. Not having a car can prevent from polluting the earth and benifit us as people in a much better way. Not having a car will stop accidents, prevent deaths, and save you money.

In Vauban, many families now do not own cars. Heidrum Walter states ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car could actually make you a much happier person as well. You would'nt have to worry about spending too much money on gas or even getting into accidents. If you have to go somewhere far, you can just hop on a subway or pay for a taxi. I know, your probaly thinking: Paying for a taxi or paying for a subway ticket cost money but definately not nearly as much as having a car.

Next, without having to drive cars, our air we breath in will be much less polluted then it would be with cars. Paris evenually ended up on banning driving because the smog was so harsh to the environment. Anyone who drove cars were then fined. According to the article

Paris bans driving due to smog

""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Congestion is car traffic so therefore, there was less smog in the air. In the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota , it states ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" Anyone who violated the rule was then fined a specific amount to stop the people from driving cars. Businessesman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air polution.""

Not owning a car can help you and your family become closer because you will have to walk places together, it will help you stay fit and it will benifit the companies because they will start to boom. In  source 4, Michael Sivak says ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" This means that more families are getting rid of their cars then they ever have before which will make the families closer. Walking everywhere will help you stay fit because your walking not sitting. Last but not least, companies will begin to boom. Source 3 states that ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks: rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic: and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" They are trying everything they can to make this world a better place. They are redoing a bunch of stuff just to show that they care. So lets show them that we care about our world too.

So lets think about the benifits of not having a car. You will be less stressed, you'll be in less accidents and you will save money. If I could have that decision I totally would take it. It is benifical for all of us so lets just live life healthy.                                          ",4

One nation under god"", they say, so why do we still have other people determine our nations future? we should be able to have say over our country, atleast when it comes to picking the president. Yeah, We vote for the Electorals that are going to vote for our president, but how do we really know if they are. There are alot of schemes now a days regarding the government, our Electorals can just get paid off to promote one president but then vote for another.

On source 2 "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford plumer says"" Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes.""  I mean not only is the Electoral college unreliable but it is also confusing to some. At the end of the day even if we have some say in picking our president if he doesn't have enough electoral votes, he is still going to lose. It doesn't even matter if we vote anymore. On source 2 ""what's wrong with the electoral college?""  Bradford explains "" in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the demcratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kenneddy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" This, is what I mean by unreliable, we can't trust our Electorals, we should be able to vote directly! who we want as our president and not some shady second party.

Another thing i would like to address in source 3 ""Big States"" Richard says "" A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state doess..."" Exactly, if we do popular votes, candidates can just go to states and try to win them over as oppossed to Electorals taking claim of one state . Also if we approve popular votes, that one smalll state , could just make a difference on who wins so in other words, every state counts and every vote counts.                                             ",3
0571af0,"The world is advancing, technologies are being built, and the enviroment is changing. Imagine living in an area where there's a limited car usage. It might sound horrible but life goes on without cars. As to limiting your car usage it also has it's advantages. The advantages goes towards the people and the enviroment.

To start, everyone would know that the main reason is because of the state of our enviroment. There's a lot of pollution going out there in the world and it's not safe or natural. To give an example, according to the article, written by Elisabth Rosenthal, ""In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", passenger cars are responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas and fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. To exemplify, greenhouse gases is one of the causes for the changes around the environment. They're not the good changes either. To support this, the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", written by Robert Duffer, shows an example of Paris and China banning car usages due to their high pollution and smogs. Robert Duffer states, ""Congestion was down sixty perent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In other words, polllution can hold a great affect of people trying to go to work, have fun, or even visit someone. Not only is change in the enviroment is bad but some people can just live without the use of transportation.

The continue to the advantages, the people get to spend their time with others more and even be happy just walking around. Going back to the article ""In German Suburb, life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer,  Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" To extend this, having a car would cause some people to be tense and stressed. Without the ability to do anything about it but just sit there or walk, it is much better to walk around with the people who's close. Another example would from the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selksy, another commentary made from a businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees with it. Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In other words, not only is the car-free day works for helping improve the enviroment, it's good for releasing stress for few people.

To conclude, letting go of driving around may sound like a disadvantage but it's actually an advantage to those around us. It's an advantage for both the enviroment and us. Who wouldn't want a stress-free enviroment?            ",4
05806ed,"Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was looking for somwhere to land on Mars for Viking 2 when it sppoted a showdow that looked like a face. The enoemous head was nearly two miles from end to end. The facewas just a natural landform.

Only few scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact. But the article states that when NASA unvieled the image for all to see, the caption that went with it noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembled a human head... formed by shadows giving an illution of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also in the article it says the author even reasoned ""it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention on mars"".

The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon.

On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharpper than the orginal photo revealed it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument.

Of course not everyone was happy. It's much cooler to have it be a alien artifact than a natural landform. People weren't giving up. The face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter of April 98' when the camera on bored of MGS had to peer through clouds to see the face. Skeptics said the alein markings were hidden by haze.

Mission controlers prepared to look again. The article states that ""we just don't pass over the face very often"".

On April 8, 2001, it was acloundless summer day; the Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look. In the image things were three times bigger than the Vikings one so you could easily see if there were shacks or small airplanes.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. These are landforms common around the American West.

This all proves that the so called ""Face on mars"" was just a landform and not from alien artifacts. The shadows from the landforms made it appear to look like a face but it was just a cauincedince. ",3

The ¨Face¨ on Mars is not an actually face at all. If there were life on Mars, this life definitally wouldn´t be enormous as it say in the artical ¨Unmasking the Face on Mars¨ in paragraph one. It states, ¨An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.¨. Another reason why the face isn´t life on mars it that in paragraph twelve Gravin talks about how this face remind him of similar landforms back on Earth. Garvin also says how there are common landforms around the American West, so if there was life on Mars why would there be simlar landmarks on Earth? The staement Garvin say is that ¨It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,¨ Garvin also mentions that the landform in Idaho is the a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same size as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion, The Face on Mars isn´t any type of life or aliens because there are similar landforms in the American West of the U.S. like the lava dome in Idaho that Garvin says is similar in size and it looks the same. Another quote in this article is ¨An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be looking at back at the cameras.¨ now if there was to be life on Mars, the life would not be enormous I can tell you that.

058ecd3,"Limiting car usage isnt such a bad idea. For starters, it helps keep a friendly enviroment, it also saves money and time for people to get to know eachother and talk a little more.

To begin with, limiting car usage would help keep a healthy, clean enviroment. In the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars' Elisabeth Rosenthal states that ""the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communtities, and legislatures are starting to act, if cautiously."" Which shows that less car usage would help protect our enviroment. Not only the enviromental agency, but the government and people agree. Also in the article 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert states that ""the smog cleared up enough Monday for the ruling French part to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" giving us the fact that th esmog from the cars was hurting the eviroment and causing smog and reckless driving.

Secondly, limiting car usage would would save money and gas. In the article, 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert Duffer says that ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined-diesles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France."" We all know diesles an expensive gas, that more than half of France has to pay for just to get from place to place. It also proves that reckless driving and smog from cars can cause damage to someones pockets with fines.

Lastly, reduced driving can help people within the same community, get to know eachother better because your either riding around on a bike or walking, giving you the chance to associate with your neighborhood friends. As stated in the article 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' , ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resteraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" which shows that driving had good aspects and helped the communty get along more.

In conclusion, thats why limiting car usage would have a good affect on our communities and a good affect on th ewhole world in general, because it helps keep a friendly enviroment, and it saves money and time for family and friends.    ",3

059af98,"Scientists are striving to meet the challenge of exploring the dangerous planet of Venus. Scientist believe that long ago Venus may have supported various forms of life. Looking up at Venus from Earth is a safe distance to visualize the planet since it is very challenging to examine it more closely. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. These dangers include the enviroment, but it is worthy pursuit becuase it part of human curiosity, and innovation.

The atmosphere of Venus is very harmful since it is coated by a thick blankets of carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is coated.""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(paragraph 3).

The temperature are also extreme on Venus. The average temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience on earth. This pressure can crush a submarine. The temperature can liquefy many metals. Venus has eurpting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Venus is now an inhospital to any form of life.

Human curiosity drives scientist eagerly to explore this planet despite of the many danger is upholds. Many scientist believe that Venus could have a been able to support life long time ago. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" (paragraph 4). Scientists also believe that Venus can be be our nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many forms of light cannot penatrate the dense atmosphere so we cannot takepictures, nor can they take rock,gas, or anything else.

Landing and exploring Venus can lead to innovation for humans. NASA is looking for more solution to be able to study Venus. They are testing out old technology so they can combine it with new technology like the computer. These experiences can innovate many other technology so that we can explore venus. In paragraph 7 it states tha ""these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all "".

In conclusion there are many challenges that make things difficult to explore Venus. There is a purpose to explore Venus. NASA is trying to still pursuit solutions to these challenges so that human might actually have a chance to explore this dangerous but amazing planet.

05aacdb,"The advantages of limiting car usage has errupted since the year 2005. America's love affair with vehicles has been like the love of their children. Most people cant get any where without a car; they begin to believe that without a car you cat go anywhere, but if they look at the bright side America has many uses of transportation such as bus, train, plane, car pool, hiking, skating, bicycle, and walking. By using these ways of transportation many places around the world will find that is much easier then using a car everyday; maybe if we tried to make these federal transportation toals in our city then maybe air polution will decrese or even go away completely. There has been many improvement campaigns around the world such as Bogota's day without cars and Paris's driving ban due to smog. Many counties, cities, and states around the world are finding ways of transportation without cars and we should to. A world without cars is a utopia of a new way of living because many people are much happier this way.

As a result, to a world without cars Vauban, Germany's people has said a life without cars is wonderfull even if it takes a little more time to get places. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families donot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainor and a mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor""(Rosenthal.3). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal's statistic Vauban's citizens are happy in this new way of life; they have learned that a life without cars can be different' but happier so that they can go through out their busy days without hearing the sound of an ongiong car zooming pass them as they walk the streets of their cities.""Vauban's streets a COMPLETELY car free besides the tram to downtown Feiburg and a few streets on the edge of the community""(Rosenthal.2). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal Vauban's streets being car free is a easier life; there is less traffic while trying to get to work in the morning, or even trying to get home, and picking up your kids in the afternoon.

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer.10). Paris being near pollution has caused them to enforce a partial driving ban on its cities people. In my oppinion Paris going into over pollution would cause it population to die to the lost of many lives because of air pollution. After 5 days of intesifying the smog congestion decresased and there was many people rerouting their daily lifes to acounter the partial ban on their daily lifes. ""On monday many motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day""(Duffer.11). Almost 4,000 motorist were fined that day because they did'nt want to listen to a simple order. Due to the partial ban the congestion of motor vehicles decreased by 60 percent in the capital of france. This ban is a good way to take away the stress of putting gas in your vehicles, finding someone to fix your car when it has broken down and a possible cure to lowering the global effect of air pollution.

As a result, to America's campaigns and organizations to keep U.S. drivers off the street and on public transportation the number of people driving and the number of people getting their license has decresased since 2009. Demographic shifts in the driving population has caused the population of many places around the world to stop driving cars and find new ways to get around. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and federal transportation toals, that mattering on its out come, may become a law throught the whole of the United States within the next six years. This law may cause many U.S. citizens to become upset because of the restrictment of something they use through out their daily lifes. Most people in the U.S. think that driving is the only way to get around but there are many ways of transportation mattering on where your going and how fast you want to get there.    ",4

As it was stated canidates never spend time with other states and they feel their votes dont really count during the election. I think it would be better if the canidates would vist every state and talk to them about what changes would be made if theyre the president.

The state legislatures are more responsible than us as voters so probably our vote doesnt really matter. Also the elctoral college truly dont pay attention to the problems about the votes and states that dont have a spark of hope that arent effected by the election but in elections it gives the chance as voters to express that political knowledge and background who would be best as our president.

Other than that the other side of the argument is reasonable too. Theyre good outcomes to it like the voter most of them upstate really pay close attention to the election they take all this information on each canidates to know who to vote and they are the most thoughtful during it.

People love cars but also love money some love money more than cars people could save a lot of money on gas if they didn't have a car or cut low on they're mileage and use another type of transportation.""when I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way"" said heidrun walter a media trainer and mother of two. in the united states, the environmental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. If more people tried the ""car reduced"" program the air we breathe would be much better then it is right now.

More places are trying to reduce car rates which I highly doubt but it never hurts to try. Even paris bans driving; paris bans driving because they want to cleant the air of the global city. ""even-numbered license plates were ordered to leace their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"".  Also Diesel fuel was blamed for the smog in France because 67% of the vehicles in France is made for Diesel. The smog cleared enough on monday but there's no saying that the smog is not going to come back... the plan to ban even and odd numbers plate licenses was a great idea for people of French they should do that every couple months so they could avoid the Smog. In Bogota, Colombia people are also having car-free day which is outstading for the community and for the the people in Bogota, Colombia.""it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day wtihout cars in this capital city of 7 million"". the goal of banning cars is to promote alternative transportation and redcue smog. the more we use alternative transportation is more money the goverment and the people that doing they're jobs as alternate drivers.""It's a good oppurtinity totake away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Also the event was doing so well that two other Colombian cities joined such as Cali, and Valledupar.

""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years befoe the downturn"" said Micheal sivak who studied the trend and who is aresearc proffesor at the university of Michigan's transportation research Institute. the downturn must be now because as I see now almost everybody has a car these days old cars,recent cars, brand new cars, and all types of cars. "" i think that means something more fundamental is going on"". if the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will have beneficial implicants for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second lagest source of America's emissions. Also more car companies are trying to make cars that are eco friendly like hybrid,Tesla, and the volt. the volt is an electric car that does not any gas run.               ",2
05b01a4,"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star"", is the closest thing to Earth as far as the base planets go. It is often called Earth's twin, even if it doesn't seem that way. The surface temperature is nearly 800 degrees Fahrenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth. This being said, scientists are still fascinated by Venus, as it could have been just like Earth long ago. Despite the dangers it presents, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because it could lead to many scientific discoveries, and set foot on another planet and gather data, and see what happened to Venus and possibly find out how to prevent it from happening to Earth.

Even getting to Venus may seem like a stretch, but keep in mind that it is at times the closest planet to us, which is important considering the long time frames of space travel. Furthermore, even with the harsh surface temperatures, there's a way around it. A vehicle hovering Venus would still be able to get data about the planet without burdening itself with the the tough conditions. Even if this can only provide limited insight, scientists are working everyday to on technology that lasts long enough to be able to get meaningful samples such as soil, rock and gas. For example, NASA has developed simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus-like conditions, and they lasted about 3 weeks in the harsh temperature and pressure. Another project is looking to the past to mechanical computers, computers that don't use electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. They could be made to withstand the conditions of Venus, while also taking data and making calculations for study.

Although there are many challenges that need to be overcame and scientific breakthroughs that need to be discovered before we even think about sending anything to Venus, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because of the discoveries it could hold. From regular rock and gas to preventing a catastrophe, scientists should continue to study our sister planet, and see what's really beneath the surface. ",3
05b0858,"Venus is the second plannet closest planet closest to the sun and has the tempature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents because of the challanges and resources that may occur. NASA has shown from this study that nobody has touched this planet because of their preventions.

Venus is a worthy pursuit of studying despite the danger it presents from the challenges that occur. From knowing the risks of people not surviving to be able to stay on a planet for more than a few hours, it makes it more of a challenge to at least touch venus. Although the text states, ""NASA’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This shows that this is the safest spot to be close enought to venus. The text also states, ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."" From the text, it has shown that nobody has the problem of going to venus for a study, just as the problem of coming back survived and healthy. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by seeing what people are capable of managing to do.

From studying Venus that can pursuit many resouces that are and could be presented in this project. NASA sees this as a processing challenge by having resources that could be processed. For an example, the text states ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."". By having a device that could help the danger and requirements, could solve the solution of the pressure in the atmosphere. If NASA is able to get to the planet, there will be many sources to be brought back for examination to study. For an example,""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."", the text has shown their are many types of feauture to be explored. The text also states,""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."", from this iy shows that if the resoucres come reasonable to use, it could increase the possibility.

From the study of venus it has shown knowing how it can increase the production of each challenge and resouce. It is possible to be completed with correct amount of studying . Studying impacts on how much you know of the project to process through all of the steps. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts by the challenges and resources being presented.",4
05b31a1,"Venus is rather uninhabitable, or is it?

Although dangerous, one would not say uninhabitable, as that implies it is impossible. the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" Discusses how it is perfectly plausible, and even worth it! That is, only if we have the correct equipment to do so.

Now while there are dangers, such as sulfiric acid clouds, metal melting heat, earthquakes, lightning strikes, volcanoes, and the mechanism shattering atmospheric pressure (Paragraph 3), you may ask ""Why go through the trouble if the conditions are so horrible?"". The reason is that it was so much like earth long ago, oceans and rock formations, even theoretical life!

NASA is helping with this idea via brainstorming for ideas to study venus, the first is to hover above it, avoiding all the surface problems, and still being close. The only issue, as provided by the author, wouldnt work, because while they would be in the air, the clouds would be too thick to allow anything, thus rendering the idea useless.

Another NASA idea is to use different electronics, like simpler models, and having them TAILORED for venus, such models lasted up to 3 weeks even! If those do not work, instead of moving foreward in our electronics, NASA would move back, back to the 1940s with mechanical computers, levers and gears computing what a normal computer could quicker and better, but while the mechanical option is slower, it is MUCH more durable.

With all of these ideas, I feel the author did an outstanding job supports this idea, and I support it whole-heartedly, it may be possible in the coming years, as our technology rapidly evolves, so do we, what do you think?",3
05b37db,"It was either I'm against or for the value of using technology to read students emotions. I happen to be against it, because yo uuse technology for working not reading emotions first of all. Two, we aren't lab rats.

I think that if you want to find out your emotions, you're pretty weird from my point of view. You should know how you feel, not letting a computer or any other technology ran device to find out your emotions. If you don't know your emotions that's because you have mixed thoughts. Your facial expression that you show to people as you walk around should tell them how you feel, for instance; looking upset shows many emotions, smiling could mean you're happy or just faking it because you're actually really depressed and don't want anyone to know. This technology that people are creating just to do that is a waste of time. Do something different, don't focus on something that people may not really even use. There are more reasons on way I am against it because all it did was just show a painting's emotions.

Therefore, that is why i am against this facial Action Coding Device. It makes no sense to me at all on why anybody would want to create this type of technology. ",2
05bcd1b,"th author supports this idea by giving me information on how close venus is and how the dangers on the planet is. the author also goives me the conditions on venus. the author also lets me know the terrain on venus and how its our nearest option for a planetary visit.

Venus is also known as the eaving star even tho that description is miss leading to scientists. the evidence i have is that venus is not habitable at all. venus is not habitable for many reasons. Venus is a very dangerous planet for us humans. Venus has a high level of carbon dioxide. Venus atmosphere is just a thick layer of carbon dioxide wich makes it hard

for humans to actully get through. As an example, every space craft thats been hasnt survived as long as just a couple hours. the pressure is also 90x srtonger than what we experience here on earth.

The only safe way to actully see and study venus is to hover over the planet just to keep scientists safe. Venus's is so much of a dangerous planet, scientists arent even able to get samples or rocks or gas.",2

What if something goes wrong with the driverless car or what if the car doesn;t go the way that you want it to go or what if you crash? Do you just blame it on the car like its the cars problem or is it the persons problem? What if it your car gets damaged badly can they fix the driverless car and will they have parts for it?

I also idea because what if you have to call someone or text someone and its something important. I think they're also good for navigation. You could just tell the car where you want to go and it will take you there. It could probably cause less accidents because its ran by a computer and usually the people fault foir the accidents but what if the computer just stops working? Does that mean that the car just stops working?

Before they realise the car I think that they should have better technology first. The technology now is amazing but I don't think a computer can be smart enough to drive a car just yet.

05c4acd,"A person who thinks that the Face on Mars is a alien is not right because I the scientist knows that it's not aliens because we have research on it. Even though it may look like an ailen it's not, it is just a natural landform.

In papragraph seven it states on April 5 1998 that the scientist took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Alo it revealed on a JPL web site that it was just a natural landform. Also that there was no alien monument after all.

If the person who still thinks it was created by aliens is stupid because NASA has proof the it is a natural monument. I would show them the photos and have proof that it was. Anyways they would be able to see it way better in the picture and see that i was right.

In paragraph 12 it says that the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ""The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, a face created by aliens and put on Mars is unrealistic. It had to be God or just a natural lanfrom. NASA has proved it in 2001. They also have pictures of the landform. Therefroe it was not aliens.

When we noticed it eas just a mesa in the face. When some people herad about it they thoght it was aliens who made that. We then told them that it was just a mesa that when the shadows hit it it made it look like a face. And that nasa's budget wish there was an ancient civleization on mars.

05c94e5,"Studying Venus

Planets are a very interesting, Earth, Mars , Venus, and others are all planets in the solar system. Venus is an interesting one, and one that not much is known about. This is why Venus must be explored and have discoveries made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why that is. The planet Venus would save time while visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made.

Venus is worth being studied because it is one of the closer planets to Earth. It is a planetary neighbor to earth. In the article ,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states,"" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Par. 4).Because Venus is a closer planet to Earth time could be saved and there would not be a worry about time being lost as if traveling to a different planet.

Secondly, Venus has similarties to Earth, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Par. 4). Just like on Earth Venus also includes the same quality land features. Going to Venus and discovering the way the land features form would be a magnificent thing to discover and being able to see how the earthquakes and natural disasters appeasr.

Lastly, while exploring Venus, reasoning for the temperatures and dangers of Venus could possibly be prevented. If someone was to discover how to prevent the dangerous factors then maybe there would not be a problem to land on Venus. Making that discovery is important and would help scientists learn more about Venus. The article states,"" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth""(Par. 3). Taking time to discover Venus could be a great thing.

Although Venus is a dangerous Planet with crucial temperatures, exploring the planet could be very beneficial to scientists and multiple discoveries could be made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why it is. The planet Venus would save time when visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made. Contributing to the study of Venus may be challenging, but in the end would be quite beneficial and would make a difference. ",3
05cafcf,"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in schools is a great idea.

Teachers always want to know if you understand the lessons and objectives they are teaching you.

If you're anything like me then you will just act like you know what's going on because you don't want to ask any questions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

If teachers had the Facial Action Coding System device on hand they could easily see how the students are feeling about a particular lesson.

This would work well for the students that don't share their opinions in the classroom or at all.

If students did not understand a lesson the emotion reading device could show the teacher how the students are feeling.

If the device shows students are confused or bored, the teacher could modify the lesson to better the students and increase their knowledge capacity and possibly make it more entertaining.

The technology could also help the teenagers express how they truly feel because some teenagers are hard to read.

Some teens, like myself, have a resting face that makes me look angry at the world and unapproachable.

I think a device like this would show that some peers are not as angry or upset as their resting face shows.

Also, most communication takes place over technology nowadays.

Personally, my school has laptops and I think it would be great if the software was on our devices because emotions play a huge role in everyone's lives.

This software would also help numerous school guidance counselors across the globe because they deal with all sorts of emotions everyday.

I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be exremely helpful.

The technology has the intelligence to identify mixed emtions which is helpful because most people have trouble percieving facial traits and expressions.

If my school had this software, I would be all over it trying to find out how I feel because sometimes I don't even know my own emotions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

I think that you should participate because you get to go on a cruise like Luke did and the story of A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves story. Also you get to have fun and If you have not been on a cruise before you get to try to have fun why you are doing your work like going to check on the animals but be careful. If you like to be a cowboy and a cowgirl you can participate in the program if you like cruise's and animals. You can always can help out the animals and the people if you see them and you trouble like trying to get there animals to eat and you see them going crazy you can help out. Luke's claims from the article that he try's to like help out the animals by going to check on the animals ever each time to get his work done on time. He one time failed down the stairs to check on the animals but he couldn't work becaues his rib was broken but he was doing fine. Luke was always do his work but he do a good job to finish his job on the cruise. Luke claims was okay because he try to get done so he can check on the animals because he don't wont to get fired from the Cowboy Waves program because he like working as a cowboy he might be a cowboy that's might be why he work there because he can talk to his friend's and he might give people visit's on the cruise to see the animals to get food and to see the animals to. Luke might show you the place if you participate and the program i will to because it sound fun to be and the program.

05d73d1,"Driverless cars would be very effeiciant. There are many pros to having them and it would be very beneficial for many reasons.

Like Sergey Brin said, these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis. Since we're already started to run out on this fuel, having these types of cars would benefit us very greatly. If self driving cars could get better alerts for when the driver needs to do something, it would be easier for people to multi task as well. Self driving cars would also be better, because less crashes would happen. From the text, sensors can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response than a human driver could manage. More improvememnts could make driving much more safer.

Although the self drivng cars are not completly driverless now, it would be very possible to do so with funding. If it were possible to make a car completely driverless, there would not be so much doubt about them. There would also be much more safety. Self driving cars would be very reliable. If it is possible to have them by 2020, a lot could change about transportation.

I think this is unnessesary because the future generation isn't going to learn how to drive an actual real car. Cars that humans can actually drive.

In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Flordia, and even the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Yeah, it's okay to have driverless cars around, but only for certain emergencies. Driverless cars can even take over people's jobs! And what are those people going to do without a job?

If the technology fails and someone is injured, who's at fault the driver or the manufacturer? Probably the driver because he or she didn't took over when the emergency was occuring. And what if that certain person didn't have a license? Even though traffic laws change we are still not garunteed that we will be safe inside a driverless car. New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident.

In conclusion, we are still going to be in risk. I still think it's a ridiculous idea. I predict that they are going to be more accidents than they are in regular cars. The road to autonomous cars stretches on over the years. We are growing closer and closer to the destination every day. Do you think driverless cars will take over? ",3
05efbec,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author, Nick D'Alto explains how a recent technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" reveals human emotions in pictures. This is actually rather convincing to believe. How can you identify a picture's emotions through a new software? The use of the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" used to read facial emotional expressions is not valuable to students in classroom because it seems too expensive for a public school to use, it looks to be more useful at images, and video games.

""Facial Action Coding System"" is not useful to students in a classroom because it is expensive and mostly unaffordable for all classes. D'Alto explains what this technology is made up of, and its component looks expensive. On paragraph 3 the author explains that, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" (D'Alto 3) Having a 3-D model computer in classes not less than a hundred is money consuming and might ruin the school's budget. Having such prestige technology in class does not mean the students in the classroom will learn better or try changing their facial expressions.

Also, most of these type tehnologies are useful mainly at expensive images such as Mona Lisa portrait. This type of system only helps solve the mysteries behind old images such as Mona Lisa and not students' emotions. The author reveals that. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" (D'Alto 6) This shows that the Facial Action Coding System is mainly useful for such mystery portraits. It only helps solve people's curiosity rather than help students in classrooms.

Lastly the new technology also help make computer expressions more real in video games. Dr. Huang explains that, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive__ for video games or video surgery."" (D'Alto 6) This evidence shows that the new software is more valuable at helping video gemes to look more real than helping students to study harder or to succeed.

Lastly, the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" is not relevant for students in classroms because it is unaffordable, mainly useful for expensive portraits, and video games. There are many disadvantages than advantages for using the new technology at schools. The new system is more useful at video games and expensive portraits such as Mona Lisa's than in schools.",4

Cars that can drive themselves can also be alot safer for the people traveling inside them and for the people around them. Smart cars will sense the world around them, and they can help make things like trafic jams and road blocks safer for everyone involved. As the text states, "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should take over. Other options under consederation are flashing lights on the windsheild and other heads up dispalys. Manufacturers are also consiering useing cameras to watch that drivers are remaning focused on the road. While the driver watches the road. the car watches the driver."" This quote from the text tells us that the smart cars will alart us when danger is ahead so that we will be prepared. This will help prevent colisions with other cars and pedestions.

Allthough the driver will still have to be paying attention o the road, he or she could relax knowing that they are in the hands of a smart driverless car. In the text it says,""We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way."" This quote is saying that the driverless cars will be a fun alternative to the manual cars we drive today. The new smart cars will be a relaxing and fun car for the future.

The driverless car has many positive facters, but it also has a few negative facters. There is the posabitaly that the car can malfuction, or not sense an accident.

The driverless car will take time to perfect, but when it is complete it will be a masterpice.

Smart driverless cars are the future. They can provide safety like cars today can not. They are also a more fuel effecent way of transportation.

venus is getting referred as earths ""Twinn"" over time humans have been sending numerouse spacecrafts to land on the cloud-draped world where no spacecraft is able to survied the landing for no more the a few hours . There a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxdie blankets venus in our solar system. But did you kniw the avergae temperature is over 800 degrees one hot planet. Did you also know that farenneit and the atmosheric pressure is also 90 times greater that what humans experience on our own planet . Notable venus has the hottest sureface temperatue or any planet in our whole solar systam. They say that the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes to probe seeking to land on its sureface. Wow our planet is so inhospitble it includes valleys and mountains and craters . so instand od sending spacecraft out they used a computer that was made in the 1800 cause that computer that does not require using electroics this computer goes off on of calculations by using gears and levers modern computer are enormously powerful , flexible and quick to extreme physical conditions . Humans will likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors . to where it should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and invaion to the challenge of exploring venus.   ",1
05fa43a,"Using this technology that could read emotional expressions of students is very valuable. Imagine someone acting to be really happy with a big smile in their face, and then actually being upset about something. The article had a lot of possitive points about this technology.

A lot of people would say no to this technology because they are getting checked by a computer. Some are also very excited to see if the computer would actually say how they are feeling and their imotions they are feeling. It can calculate how you feel just by constructing your face and seeing how all 44 mucles of your face are.

Dr. Huang says ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expresion."" He is trying to say that even when people try to change the way their face acts. The computer may still know how your actual emotions are. These new technology is so amazing because it can even be on your own PC.

Scientst have used these technology to in many things. They have used it specially in the famous art work of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. They have found out how she was actually feeling when she was being drawn. These new technology can actually calculate every emotion. Even if it is in the past.

All these amazing things about this technology should be valuable in classroom. The students would be able to study new things about how this actually works. How it can make everyone feel better about it. The students actually doing this things with these technology would actually make them a bit happier. This is why this technology that reads expressions should be valuable in a classroom. ",3
05ff7b3,"Now you can actually know how thye feel by an app. This is now something that is being used to recognise the emotions of old paintings and it might actually be good for people. it will be able to tell how you really feel, it can hlp kids in school. and it also helps produce emotions.

We all know someone that says they are fine but they think something else, but we cant fingure out how they also feel. But with this new program it will be way easier and that is a good thing. ""the software can even identifiy mixed emotions.... each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)."" Since this software can tell peoples emotions it could help in therapy with things, like if a person comes in for therapy but says they feel good about it but they dont act like it the therapist could do this test and see what they are having trouble with or how they really feel about the subject at hand.

Some kids can get bored in school and just zone out because the material they are being taught does not click with them but that can be changed with this new program. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Dr. huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" this could benifit both the school system and the child. the child will be more attentive with the lesson if he or she understands it or they think it is interesting and then they might even score higher in school, and have a better futre.

Some people might just look mean when you walk by them, or it may even be you that always gets asked ""You always look mad so i dont talk to you."" nut now since this program came out, the theory that comes with it is that it can help you produce new emotions. "" According to the Facial feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them."" this can benifit poeple in many ways. They might become happier and more out going. They could have better oppertunities when it comes to work because they have a good attutide.

This new facial feedback could be really good for us as people. it could halp many peoplr in thier lifes. ",3
06041d8,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the auhtor did not make enough evidence and information on why it would be of great value to explore our twin planet, Venus. Most the article was relaying challenges, or risks, as some might say, and probable solutions to those risks. The part in the article on why it would be of great value to study Venus does not give us a lot of reason why.

For most of the articel the author was giving was reasons why there unmanned missons to visit and why a single spaceship has not touched down on Venus in more than three decades. One reason as he explain was Venus's atmosphere. Another was the enivornment of our neighboring planet Venus.

Mostly the other part of the article was soltuions to Venus's challenges. He talk about how NASA had an idea to use an blimp-like trasnportation to avoid Venus's harsh enivorment. He also explained NASA's othe plan to use mechanical computers some modern technology wouldn't burn up and melt due to Venus very humid temperatures.

At the end of the article, in the last paragraph, is where the author briefly gave he reason for why studying Venus would be a good idea. He brings up recieveing insight on the planet. Also he brings up the hunger human curiosity and that it will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Based on the information explained in this essay, the reason is now known why the author did not do a good job supporting why explorating Venus would be of great value.

I believe that it is i good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring to you, help you understand what you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

One reason why it is a good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring for you. The computer can help find a video or something that can help the work be for fun or extced for you. For example, say that I do not like math or i can not figure out what the answer is because i am bored the computer can find a video to help me.

Another reason, is it can help you learn something you do not know. For example say the teacher does not explain a problem correctly and so the computer looks up a video or something that can explain the problem.

Last reason, is the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

For example the computer will look at your face and will see that you can not do a problem and sees your frustration and the computer will look uo an article,video,etc.. that will help you and it will give you instuctions on how to do something.

In conclusion, as you can see the technology to read the emotinal expressions of student's is a great idea because it can help you something that boring to you, help you understand something that you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.            ",3
0607ed1,"Dear senator,

I would like to say that the electoral college is not what we should be using to elect our presidents. I think the electoral college is not what Americans need. In the electoral college process, many thing could go wrong. The system does not work as many people think it does, as it is very deciving and unfair. Over half of all voters agreed that we should abolish the system and go by popular vote.

The electoral college is unfair due to the fact that peoples vote is not even going to the president but for his electors. The biggest moral of the country is ""we the people"" have control. The trickery of the electoral college is not allowing this to happen but taking it away. It is mainly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. The electoral college interfered in the the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush by allowing Bush to win even though more people voted on Al Gore in popular vote.

The many flaws in the system or mistake that can happen are more likely in the electoral college. The is a possibility that the two presidents can tie and in which case they have to go through a long process. This can happen due to an even number of electoral votes overall (538). The electors in the state of Louisiana have refused to vote for their party's canidate and vore for whoever they please ant that is not right. You can pay electors to vote one way which is also wrong too considering that not what the people think.

Many people agree that they system should be abolished including two presidents the united states Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Over half of all voters at over 60% agree that the system should be abolished. These statistics were taken in a Gallup Poll in 2000 shortly after Al Gore was not elected. The Obama vs. Romney race was won by Obama who had 61.7 % of the electoral votes versus he had only 51.3 % of the popular votes.

That's it! The electoral college is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"" as Bradford Pulmer clearly staes it. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis of reality. Due to the many flaws and/or mistakes that can happen the electoral college should not be used. I have to agree with Nixon and Carter: ""Abolish the Electoral college!""                                                    ",3
608495,"The future is coming. Many new technologies will be developed over the next few years, and ideas that people have had for decades will finally have the possibility of becoming a reality. Flying cars, human-like robots, anything you can possibly imagine could very well be introduced into our future.

Although many new problems will arise with these new developments, setbacks such as driving/traffic laws, or the argument of who would be at fault in case of an accident will only be a ripple in the ocean that is our technology. These devices should most definitely be tested for years to come before they even begin to release it into the population, but in the end, I certainly agree that they could furiously enhance our style of living, and ultimately, safety for those around us.

For any of these ideas to become a reality, there is going to have to be many years of testing ahead, and many trials and errors, but in order for the human race to move forwards, as it has in the past, there are always risks and precautions that need to be taken, and warnings that we must heed. In the pass, countless lives have been taken in the name of science and technology, and I highly doubt that as we move forwards into our future, that will change much. People will always struggle to further the comfort of their living, even if that means taking from other people. It makes me wonder if technology such as this is actually going to be beneficial for our society. As I think about the health risks and funding needed for advances such as these, not to mention the threat of war from other countries, I begin to realize that maybe we will reach a point in the future where technology will no longer be beneficial to us, but instead, be counterproductive in the overall wellbeing of the world.

When all the facts are laid before me, with no deceit hidden behind fine print, only then will I believe that technological advances can only bring good into this world. Even today, it is becoming more and more apparent that social media and cellphones have altered our way of communication. No longer do we have to go outside to see people, or have conversations face to face, so that means that our world has become much smaller, yet also much bigger at the same time. Human confrontation may be a rare thing in thirty years, maybe even five. Although I, and most anyone else, enjoy the comfort of our technologies and lifestyle right now, there will most definitely come a time, maybe in the near future, where we regret pushing to try to make our life easier. Only time will tell when people begin to discover new ways to harm others, and when that time comes, we will regret ever pushing this far. ",3
0608fab,"In the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" Have many advantages, but i feel that the main advantage is that it is good for the planet and to lower air pollution and aslo the movement is actually working.

Helping out the planet and staying green in some way is a good thing because it helps our planet look better not only that it makes it look better but it also makes us humans and the planet Earth healthier for example the air pollution can be lowered by driving cars less,instead od driving your own car you could take the bus,walk, or ride like in the text it says

""Its's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""

I like this piece of evidence because it tels more on how being green can not only help the planet but alo tell how it can help human kind, because it helps you understand not only it can lower pollution but it can also lower your stress, but if you choice not to go along with the movement you shouldn't have to pay a fine of 5$ because to me it seems like that would be taking away a persons rights yes i get it ""

The goal is to promote altnative transportatin and reduce smog""

but a person should not be force to do so.

Another advantage could be that the movement is working

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

I like this piece of evidence from ""Source 4: The End of Car Culture"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal because it states what the president is doing to try and make our planet better, but not only that it also gives factual information by telling about fewer cars are being broughten each year and also fewer licenses are also being gotten

All in all this passage have many good advantages to help persuade people to start driving less and helping out our planet, One it is good for our planet because no one wants to live in a dirty place, Two it will help lower the bad air pollution, and Lastly is that the movement is working anyways so why not try and help out and drive a little less?                    ",3
060a4e7,"In the passage the Author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desite the dangers it presents. In the first paragraph the author says ¨Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.¨. In that quote it is saying that the Evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. It is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it. In paragraph two it says ¨Often referred to as Earths ¨twin¨, Venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth¨. In that quote it is saying that Venus is known as Earths twin because of the size. The Earth and Venus are about the same size. It also says that Earth and Venus have about the same density as each other. In my opinion I think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. When it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere. In the passage in paragraph three it says ¨A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes Venus¨. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it. My thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on Venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. They should do that so the scientists wanting to study Venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way.",1
060d2bb,"Everyone think's that it is a face that was created by aliens but its not. The thing that appears to be a face is not a face it is simply a natural landform. It is a natural landform because on April 5, 1998, global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a photo of the so called alien artifact. Their photo was ten times better than the original Viking photo so that meant they could get a better view out of it. After looking over the photo they found out that is was no alien arttifact.

But people were not satisfied. So on april 8, 2001 a summer day in Cydonia the global surveyor drew closer for a second look. As they rolled the spacecraft 25 degress to the center of the

face they took an extrordinary photo. Using the cameras absolute maximum resolution for the photo. That means for each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

You can discern things in a digital photo 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So that means if the human lookin landform was an alien artifact u would be able to see airplans on the ground. Egyption-stye pyramids, and even small shacks. But what the phoyo acually shows is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.",3
6.13E+062,"My position on driverless cars is that it is a dumb idea. It is not likley we will have them, right now they can only get up to 25 miles per hour. That is not a very fast car or at least not fast enough. We would have to change the speed limits, people would not be able to get to work on time. These are reasons I think the idea is stupid.

25 miles per hour is not a very fast car or at least not fast enough. Think about this, mostly all of our speed limits get up to 30 to 35 miles per hour. so what i am saying is that all the construction that would have to take place would be over whelming. In the text it said the car has a warning system to alert drivers about construction or wrecks. the system would be going crazy.

People would not be able to get to work on time. When a car we use now verses a ""smarter"" car the problems would be reliability and speed. In a modern day car we can sync our phones to them and have gps tell you where to go. If a modern car runs out of gas on the highway you can pull over, locate and walk to the nearest gas station with a gallon container and get more gas, then you could walk back to your car and put the gas in your car. Now with a ""smarter"" car it comes with a gps system, sure. If the ""smarter"" car however runs out of energy your navigation system will not work, and you would have to, in some way shape or form, get your car to a charging station then you will have to wait a while before its charged up and ready to go.

In conclusion those are the reasons I toatly dissagree with people that want ""smarter"" cars on the road. You can not rely on them . They are dumb and will not be able to function properly in todays society.",3

Also, Clolombia now has a car-free day that made people bike, hike and aslo take buses to work making the streets have less traffic jams. The U.S, one of the most car used nations, has been going down, and in April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was the same as in January 1995. Experts are also thinking that if they encourage people to reduce the usage of cars, that it may help the greenhouse gases problem gradualy.

So one suburb that is already been established and made an car-free zone is Vauban, Germany. This suburb has minimal parking spots and people have easy access to stores. A woman said,

""When i had a car i always tense. I'm much happier this way""

. This movement of making places car-free is called

""smart plannig""

. ""In the U.S the Envoirmantal Protection Agency is promoting

""car redused""

communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.""

In Paris, people were fined if they did not leave their car at home. This was put into place, because smog was intensifying. Also, smog is more in Paris than in any other capital in Europe. Delivery companies lost revenue, but electric cars and public transit was free of charge. After, the smog cleared the odd ruling was rescinded.

Colombia had an idea that was put into place one day and made a change in everybody. They made a program which is a car-free day which made people go hiking, biking and they rode buses to work. It made the streets clearer. It was put into place so that it woulg help the reduction of smog. This peogram helps people to know other ways to transport themselves without cars.

The U.S is the nation that has the most cars used. So, now they are trying to decrease the use of cars. A study showed that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009.

These ads are to prompt customers into buying the latest devices such as the latest computer, mac pad, the IPHONE X, the smart phone that is as thin as a piece of paper, and the widest, flattest television screen. There is something that all of these devices do not have. Now a new system called the Facial Action Coding System is reaching the surface. This system allows computers to dictate how a person is feeling by just their facial expressions such as muscle placemnts in their face, the rise and fall of cheeks and under eyelids. So is this new system valuable, and can it be beneficial to our community?

This system is beneficial to our school communities. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto its says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Hauang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" If computers were able to see how many kids were and were not ingaged in the activity that takes place on computers, then it would help the schools and the state to know what new things to try to keep kids ingaged so they can get the best possible education offered to them. This system is great for Istep test taking as well. Sometimes kids may fall asleep during testing or they may start too dose off and not be as consentrated as they should, and that could have a negative affect on their test. If the computer could read their emotions it would help us to know what the problem is and the reason why kids are losing focus and once we have confronted the problem we can then began the process of finding an affective solution.

This computer would be very beneficial in offices and in police stations. They could be used to help with criminal justice. A suspect can be told to tell their side of the story infront of a computer screen and the computer would be able to dictate that persons true emotions. This could make the officer, and investigaters job alot easier. They could be used in hospitals to keep an eye on how a paitent is feeling maybe after a recovery or when they are lying on their death bed. In the article it says "" They even can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" So there is no faking of emotions out of a crime. Its also says "" In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" There is no faking with that computer.

This new system has the ability to make our jobs alot easier. Nowadays people dont usually communicate face to face anymore. That means people dont usually express theirselves in person as much as they once did in earlier days when technology wasnt around. So this can be a way to still be able to know how someone is feeling, esspecially if they are less likely to tell how they are feeling when your right infront of them. This can be very effective with younger kids who may not know how to epress how they may be feeling in the right way, shape, or form. This new system gives us a new way to still connect with our community. This new system is a pathway to a brighter future. This new system is valuable to our community.",4

630503,"I would not think having the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is valuable. The fact that not alot of people want others to know how they feel . Especally teens these days. Teenagers hide alot of emotions for multiple reason. Simply because it can lead to alot of questioning about their life. Not everyone would want people to know what goes on in their life that makes them depressed or sad.

Eckman classified 6 basic emotions - happiness, suprise , anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Why would anyone want anyone else to know if they'er sad or disgusted? What if you was talking to some one and they had an awful smell . Then , the Facial Action Coding System just show how disgusted you are. That would not only hurt the other person's feelings but make you feel mean.

Dr. Huang noted ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" ""So computer need to understand that , too"" . Most human are nonverbal because they chose not to be. Not every one just want to sit not and talk about their feelings. Also, Dr. Huang noted , ""So computers need to understand that , too. Understand what? How might a computer understand?

People in our world today are becoming so intellegent that they can invent anything they set thier minds to.

First of all, if these car companies have been working on cars that can drive themselves since the 1900's, why should they stop now? Is giving up really worth throwing away 70+ years of hard work and dedication towards inventing smart cars that can drive themselves? NO, don't give up, continue to strive for a better and also safer future for the world today and generations to come.

Additionally, not only are these cars really cool and mind blowing, but very helpful to certain people. Imagine someone who has no arms, legs or even a disability that keeps them from driving and thier dream is to be able to drive a car one day, or even just to be able to sit in the drivers seat of an actual moving vehical. Well, with these new cars, their dreams can come true.

Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicals. No one is going to want to buy these vehicals or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicals are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars.

Not always.""[Plumer, p10].When voters vote for the Electoral college the person they put in might not even vote for who the people want for the President. The system is not only unfair when people vote, also when campagins happen in states. In paragraph 13 of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , the author states ""Because of the winner-takes-all system... candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."". With this system, we have some states that are left out of the campaign of candidates going through states, because they are not important to the candidate for winning.

In addition, not only is the Electoral college unfair, the system can fail at any given election. Plumer wrote in paragraph 11 ""...what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress."" the Electoral college is only to have one slate of electors from each state. With two slates from one state it would give both the state and the candidate an advantage over the rest of the states and the other candidate, that would turn into a disater. Not only can the states destory the Electoral college system, the system can destory itself.  Included in paragraph 12, "" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."". Even the people put into the college can ruin themselves by one or two electoral voters changing their minds.

Not everything about the Electoral college is bad. The article

In the Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our reasons despised method of choosing the President said, ""..it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.""[Posner, p18]. Even the other vote systems are strongly disliked. The Electoral system is not the most disliked system but it can also get the President everyone wants. In paragraph 19,""... a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."". A candidate for the president can't focus on one region, because it will make other states feel that they are not important.

Finally, the Electoral college should no longer exist because, it's an unfair system and can quickly turn into a catastrophe.    ",4
640183,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author Nick D'Alto desribes how a new technologhy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotion changes . Human changes are when a person can feel a little happy ,but more sadder. In this essay today I will explain how I think whether the use of the technology should be used in the classroms , based off what iv'e just read .

Based off what i just read in the text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile "" the author Nick, was explaining about how the emotion changes to Mona Lisa expressed how she felt based off cacualations using technology. In the beginning of the txet the author talked about the caculations emotions .For an example in the text text the author quoted "" She's 83 perenct happy, 9 perecnt disgusted ,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No, that's not your science

teacher , grading your lastest lab assignment . "" After , reading that example, you should have a question asking "" How did they know that "" ? .The answer to that question is rare , they knew how much percentages of each emotion was worth

because they caculated it using technology and her body strcutered muscles called Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus. That helps shows the crow-feet aroud the eyes to vertify the emotions ; bsaed off body languages.

I feel that classroms need this computred based technology because it'll tell the teacher wether if a student is feeling good, bad, or okay . I know this because according to the text the author Nick was explaing the caculations of Mona Lisa . It explained her emotions and even the percentages of the emotions. I can connect this to when I was in 3rd grade. I was getting ready for the ISAT test. That day i was not feeling good, I was feeling 80 perecnt worries , 5 perent happy, and 25 percent sad. I did not move to the next grade all because of i was worried about how will I do on the test instead of getting it out the way . My teacher couldn't tell my emotions because my emotions was hidden in silence . That's why I feel this technonlogy should be used in classrooms, but if it is being used in the classroms I hoep it change the looks at things .

After, reading my essay I hope you get a good understanding why iv'e thought it was best to have the technology in classrooms . The caculations will explain how each student is feeling each day of class. The computer will show the progress of an happy , sad , worried, or okay student . A student actions and emotions explains their feelings ,but not the percentages. However, I hope teachers and instructors chose to have the computer based technology to explain a students emotions.         ",3
640912,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. The idea of automatic cars has been around for a long time. Technology was not as advanced as it is now. Improvements in computer software is going to help make driving safer and is leading to cars that can handle more difficult tasks on their own.

Having driverless cars is a great idea. There are a lot of benifits of having driverless cars. In paragraph 1 it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world"". Having driverless cars would lower the number of deaths and crashes. Imagine someone being drunk and wanting to drive home. Having a driverless car would help that situation a lot less dangerous.

There are a lot of negative things about driverless cars. Having one of these cars would still require attention and assistance. In paragraph 7 it states, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. The necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs"". If someone is drunk or on drugs how will they know when a problem occurs? Not everyone is going to be fit to have a driverless car.

There are a lot of things a driverless car can do much better than a human can do. In paragraph 7 it states, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph...They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."". If a person is unable to break fastly the car will do it. Having a automatic car can help the person worry less because the car will help get them to their destination safely and hopefully on time. Maufacturers are also going to consider using cameras to watch the drivers and make sure they are focused on the road. An automatic car would be good in a situation if someone gets a phone call or a text message. Even though they are supposed to be watching road it will still make it less dangerous. In paragraph 8 it says, ""..Something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern"".

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. There are more positive things about a driverless car than negative. Some say why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW manager driver states, "" We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way"". The idea of driverless cars will further be an idea and the negatives will be improved. Maybe one day there will be a true driverless car.      ",4
642363,"I believe that driverless cars are a bad idea. There are issues that can be seen to cause problems. The idea of a computer doing something for you takes out the factor of doing it yourself.

If a computer beggins to start to do the work for us when wont have any work to to do which, sounds beautiful but, in reality can become a disaster. If we let a computer do something for us like drive, then we can end up never learning things like driving which is a huge part in the dalay teens life. I am a teen and I believe that if I were to be given a car that drives itself i would never use it for the simple fact i dont get to use what ive learned in drivers ed to use.

I could go on with many issues with this idea. Like, if a computer were to mess up and wreak the car who would to be at blame? Would it be the driver or the manufacturer? These are some issues that could efect people.

I just believe that cars that drive themselves are would become a bigger issue then what people think. Other people can think their oppion on the subject. But, that is just my personal oppion.",2

Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France baned Driving do to smog. Sounds Extream, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely ""

Car-Free

"". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an aditional $40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of Vauban's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA (

Environmental Protection Agency

) is promoting ""

car reduced

"" communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a car-free day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they baned driveing all togather. France desided that they where going to order even-numbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Same for odd-numbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and car-free campains have helped our environment. These countried have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to partisipate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of car-free suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.            ",4
0649f8e,"I think that you should get rid of the electoral college because it makes the popular vote unfair. If you are saying we aren't voting for the president we want then we are just voting for the electoral voters we want without knowing that. The electoral college is unfair because if we vote who we want to then we will just get the votes of some electoral voter and if we vote for them they could vote for whoever they wanted to vote for.

If everyone voted for someone thew electoral voters could just vote for whoever they wanted to and we wouln't be able to stop them either. We should change it to popular vote because the electoral college is unfair to everyone who votes for someone. Its not fair because the eletoral vote can make a president lose even if he had the popular vote is on his side.

It should be changed because there is always the disaster factor. If their is a tie then they will just deny the will of the people.

0657f4c,"What is electoral college? The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. But it is also a bad thing because you help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote for your canadate you are actually voting for your canadates electors. I think electoral collage is is a stupid process and is definitly outdated.

In the same light, I think the electoral collage is a stupid idea beacause and that they should of got rid of it a long time ago it is like were not even voteing annymore its like someone messed up the votes and said that romney got 538 votes and obama only got 438 votes. Like bob dole said,""abolish the electoral college"".

but you have to remember, the electoral college is a good thing to most presendental elections. the only one election that it didnt help on was in 2000 al gore recived more indivisial votes than george bush nationwide, but bush won the election, reciveing 271 electoral votes to gore 266.

065c240,"Outer space is a mystery within itself, but the addition of the planets and stars are just an expansion to those mysteries. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was written for readers to understand how a planet that may be different in design can be the most important reason as to why it should be taken a look at. The author compares and contrasts Venus with Earth and Mars to emphasize what Venus has to offer. Venus may not be the easiest task to complete, but that should encourage people to push the exploration of the planet.

Venus may have a variation of attributes compared to Earth and Mars, but that shouldn't stop people from exploring the planet. Since Earth and Venus are considered ""twins,"" they are similar according to their, ""...density and size, and occasionally their distance too."" (2) The author also mentions how Venus could have once been the, ""...most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" With that being said, if Venus was similar to Earth in its lifetime, then it could answer pondering questions like ""Is there any other signs of life on other planets?"" Just like Earth, Venus has, ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" (4) Venus' similar characteristics to Earth makes it an interesting mission for scientists.

Sending man to the moon wasn't the easiest trip, but it got done. So, why shouldn't Venus be explored too? Venus is said to have, ""...hostile conditions on the surface,"" (5) and it is considered, ""inhospitable."" (4) Both phrases do not appear to be the most promising when deciding if landing on Venus is the best choice, but beyond those risks could be life changing discoveries. This mission is impossible because humans are able to make, ""machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully.""

Traveling to Venus doesn't have to be the most difficult plan. Space travel already is a timely mission, but Venus is said to, ""...sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" If Venus is a close visit, then scientists should be even more compelled to search the planet. Scientist have come up with smart ideas to observe Venus like, ""a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape."" (5) With this the vehicle is close enough to explore without humans dying or the vehicle frying. The heat is dangerous, but scientists could obtain important information they've been wanting to find out.

The author informs readers on the risks of traveling to Venus. Venus is not the safest place to be close to, but dangers have never stopped people from making trips into space in the past. Venus provides many opportunities that people have to be willing to take and learn from. Danger is nothing new to society, so traveling to Venus is only the newest obstacle to bypass. ",4
06633fa,"Cars are grate inventions. We use it to move our selves and other things from place to place. Its faster and easier but all grate things have their flaws. Having a car has its advantages and disadvantages. Sure they do help a lot but if you really look into it you are causing more damage using a can than when you don't. Using a car causes car accidents and hurts our environment with harmful gasses well known as the greenhouse affect. limiting your self to usage of your car can really help a lot. I surly am cutting back on using my car because I love my environment, do you?

Cutting back on usage of car can save you a lot of money and prevent accidents from happening. when there are less cars on the road it reduces accidents with bikers, walker, and other cars. when you are involved in a car accident you someone gets hurt and you lose money. car accidents are costly. the insurance goes up, your medical bill has to be paid, the gas you used or lost, and your out of work because of you injury. that's just part of it. you have to still think about the damage you caused and have to live knowing you killed or could have killed an innocent person. money loss doesn't happen just when your in an accident. just by being a safe driver u lose money also. having a car means having to deal with insurance, mechanic, and gas. gas prices are very expensive now in days. sometimes you have to skip a meal because you only have enough for gas that day. cutting back could save you hundreds yearly even if u cut back maybe two times a week. just think about it you can prevent an accident from happening and save money just by staying home,walking, or riding a bike.

Saving money and preventing car accidents is not the only reasons you should cut back on car usage. another reason is because it hurts our environment. for every car that is being used our environment is being hurt. a car lets off bad gasses that cause the green house affect. this is not just hurting the area that we live in its also hurting other areas all over the world. the gasses that cars make is making our world heat up and ice and glaciers are getting defrosted. this harms the polar bears and causes water levels to rise and less land for us. cutting back on usage of cars can help not just us as people but our plants and animals all over the world. if u don't want to do it for the world do it for your self. cutting back and using a bike, walking or public transportation can be good for you. using a bike and walking is good exercise for you and can be a weekly thing. using public transportation can help you meet new people and make friends and get to know people. cutting back doesn't really have to be weekly even if its just one or twice every other month can still really help. if you have the choice to stay and cook or go out and eat then try to stay home and hey who knows maybe you can learn a new recipe.

Cutting back can save a life, our environment, save money, and be a healthy thing. just think about all those cute polar bears and other animals you could be saving. oh, lets not forget the plants also. just plan a day that you will just ride your bike to work and on your ride think of all the good things your doing for our community so go ahead save the environment, save your self.         ",3
06673c8,"In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" the author states how our technology is increasing so much today, that soon we will see cars that drive themselves. The author states some negative sides to the story, and some positive. But I think that driverless cars will help our country in many different ways, and I support it.

According to the author, he says will we even be able to make new cars because there are laws that do not allow some states to test them. According to the article, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars""(9). I think car manufacturers can test their cars in a factory in some states that it is legal to do it in, and once they prove that it is safe I believe that some states will uplift the laws that they have on self driving cars.

Also many people ask, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer""(9)? This is one of the main concerns of people today, but I would believe it would be the manufacturers fault since they were the ones who made the car, and designed all the parts of it. Humans should have no worry about liability for themselves because the car manufacturers should cover all the expenses that happened in the accident since they were the ones who designed the cars.

Another benifit to self driving cars is that they also would reduce half the fuel that humans use today. Accorting to the text it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world""(1). Not using half the amount of fuel today is super benificial for the enviornment since we are not polluting it nearly as much. Many people would support this because we would be help save the enviornment, and also we would not have to spend nearly as much money on gas as we normally do. Another benift is how all the cars would be safe. According to BMW,""Safety is a big concern""(8). Clearly BMW would not release the car if it was not safe, but if our country all switches to self driving cars then this will reduce the crashes, and accidents by a ton, which would be saving many lives.

Many automakers are working on developing new safety gadgets for cars, and also a couple of the automakers have alrady developed a self driving car. Tesla for example, ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time""(10). Tesla has projected that they will release a car in 2016 that 90% of the time is on autopilot. That is this year, and when they release it all the other automakers are going to try and design a better self driving car than the tesla which could make the other manufacturers come out with a new self driving car soon also. Some other automakers have said, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"" (10). This is crazy so by the time 2020 at least three more auto makers predict that they will have self driving cars also. By the 2020s we should expect my self drivin cars that will be on the road.

In conclusion there are many positives/ benifits that will come out of this self driving car. Though there are some set backs that some states/ automakers will have to over come. In the end outcome it will help drivers safety, and it will help the enviornment. In the overall outcome that is why we should have self driving automobiles.    ",4
0667fd7,"Scientist believe they have came up with a technology that can read your true emtions called FACS, or Facial Action Coding System. This technology works your emotions out like a math equation. It calculates the feelings of fear, happiness, disgust, surprise, anger, and sadness. Now they are thinking that it can be great in the classroom and benefit schools tremendously.

Feeling are told all over your face and your body language, all someone really has to do is pay attention. In the classroom though, it is very hard for one teacher to see how each child individually feels. New technology that has sprung up can do that for them now. This technology uses video memory and software that decodes the muscles in facial expressions. This could be very beneficial in the classroom because now you can see how your children feel about your lessons, and that could develope new ways to help students learn. The auhtor writes how Dr. Huang says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". ""Then it could modify the lesson like, like an effective human instructor."", this would be very wise to put in a classroom. Teachers want to know all the time what they can do for their students and how; new technology could do it for them.

Although this idea could be genius, it could have flaws just like most technology. It is hard to truly depict someones emotions, so how can a computer tell someone how they feel? Or honestly, what does a few pieces metal know about how someone is feeling? People could also say this creation is very invasive.These claims could be arguements presented when getting this type of technology into the classroom.

Even though this technology could have flaws to it,

people will never kbow till they try. They have sent pyschologists, like Dr.Paul Eckman, in to help perfect the FACS. The computer software can even predict your true emotions, regardless if you put on a fake smile. It knows what muscles are used in a fake and in a real smile. Humans use the same skill everyday according to the author, our only difference is we have trouble actually describing the emotion.

In conclusion, FACS, a system that can calculate your feelings, would be a great additon to the classroom. We introduce new technology everyday that is not benefical to schools, so why not help the school sytem. Every technology has its kinks, but who truly knows until it is tested.",3
0668f09,"The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coinsided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning cars/reducing them will benefit our ecosystems and enviornments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog; it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing (Source 2). That CO2 rises into the air, the atmopshere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of car-pooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3; and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael Sivak brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine (19 and 21) [speaking of her children] have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the enviornment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the city/town. In Bogota, Columbia (according to Source 3) new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks; DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the enviornment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and check-up like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.                                            ",5
0670d67,"Driving into the Future

What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheal vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that proccess situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and elliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.

Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can proccess situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival itme. Smart cars, as the leading industrys call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintaing eyes on the road. These cars are maintaing a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.

While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safley navigate out of it and overide the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.

With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.

Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, drving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel. I would certainley choose the computer driving me, my friends and coworkers around for my safety and theirs.",5

Driverless cars are not a good because why create a car that drives on its own but still needs assistance from a person. Driveless cars does come with special sensors such as; position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor, but with all that technology why does it need assistance. The cars we drive today does not have all that fancy sensoring but it does have some that really comes in handy. Driverless cars can steet, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as; navigating through work zones and around accidents. To save the stress of you having to take control of the wheel if you run into a problem than why not keep you car, the cars we drive now. Without any navigation or all that fancy stuff we will always have our eyes on the roads and knowing when to turn, stop, go and all that good stuff.

No matter how good a driverless car sounds I still don't think its a god idea. I feel as if its just a waist of money and products when there's more importnat things going on in the world that still hven't been fixed. Driverless cars are safe until a drunk driver or a persons who's high off something get in a dosen't pay attention to what that navigator is telling you, the same with texting and driving. So why risk someone lives when if they are driving the cars we use now more people pay attention to the roads, not many drink and drive, more and more people everyday are paying attention to the roads. ",3
0674a38,"Driverless cars would not be a smart step forward for us as Americans. Considering the fact the car can not fully function on its own it would be very difficult to deal with. If the car has to ask the driver to take over everytime it can't handle a certain situation, then make one that can and then we can advance into the new era of driverless cars.

The fact that Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver, says people would get bored behind the weel of a car controlling itself proves that people would lose focus and that may cause fatalities. When they lose focus because the car is in control and look at their phone, the car may ask them to take over on the drop of a dime, and the driver may panick. Especially if there is an oncoming car and the driverless car can not react fast enough, because it only takes a split second.

Another point I would like to make is when big name companies such as Google market anything they sell simply because of who makes it. If there is a flaw in a cars system then they would be risking a lot of peoples lives, in terms of who buys them. In paragraph eight, it reads that "" Upgrading to existing roads would be too expensive to be practical."" and that means if there is a flaw under the hood, they would lose a lot of money from a bunch or attackers, manufacturers, and their own industry crumbling.

All in all, I believe that it would not be a good way to advance in technology if we're practically selling prototypes. People would be buying driverless cars that aren't state of the art because either it was too pricy or the car itself can not handle the surprises driving may consist of and it would be a major fail on a lot of people's behalf. If we had cars that could fully function safely and accurately on the street, then we could maybe experiment on making the future present. But for now, let us work ot the kinks of the products that affiliate with people's everyday lives or even their lives period.",4
06766be,"In a argument between against or for driverless cars, I am for driverless cars. I think it's a good idea to have driverless cars. It will safer on the streets. There

should be a whole new set of laws regarding to these cars. I also think they shouldn't be released until these cars are truly driverless.

As I said earlier driverless cars shouldn't come out until they are completely do not need a driver. When they are driverless it would resolve conflict between if there were an accident who the blame would be on. The blame would be on the company that made the car because the driver isn't doing anything. I think there should still be a mode in the car where the driver can takeover if the driver sees a situation where he should control the car. I think the car should be smart enough to know how to get through traffic jam, that shouldn't be a problem. The new laws should be that all cars will have to go a certain speed. I don't see how you could get in a car accident if they are all going the same speed. Even though most people would have a driverless car, some people will still have old cars that need a driver. So if there is an accident between a driverless car and a old car that requires a driver, I think the blame should be in the driver in the old car because the driverless car is following all the laws and is going a certain speed so if there was an accident it would be on the driver that isn't following the laws. But then again the driverless car could have technical difficulties and could crash. I think the car should know when it is having technical issues and pull over to the side so the driver can take control. Even though the car is driverless I think the laws for getting your license should not change. Also some people like to drive so the should be and option that is opposite to cruise control we the driver can drive, but when you are driving you have to be ready to take responsibility for anything that happens while you are driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be a great idea. It would lead to less accidents as long as the car it programmed the right way. Texting and driving would be as big of an issue as it has been lately with a driverless car. With a driverless car there are less choices being made and less opinions. Our generation would be great to take on the challenge because we take on new things everyday with things being invented everyday. With all that being said I am for driverless cars. It is a great idea and would save lives also. ",3
678715,"Driverless cars? A car doing all the driving for you without you having to touch the wheel is of lazy. Why would you want a ""smar car"" do all the work for you. The more that the technology develops the more things people find to help you be more lazy. It's like people don't want to do anything themselves anymore.

When driving you really have to pay attention to not just yourself but other people. If you let the smart car drive you around it's not going to really be paying attention to other people. If you get in an accident and the other person gets hurt, who is to blame you, or the car? The cops will go with you, because you are an human being that can get arrested and pay insurance, not the car. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?""

So, I don't think we should have driverless cars. I believe there would be more accidents than there is now. When it comes down to it yes, this will be our future, but we can also prevent it from happening. Its all up to you.",2
0679f5a,"The author does a very good job at explaining and giving details of the passage.They give you the scientific facts and even tells you that NASA has been working on diffrent ways to study Venus.He lets you know that Venus is not an easy planet to study since it has a top degrees of 800 degrees Farenheight. He also gives information about how diffrent metals and other objects melt and liquefy after so long on Venuses surface.

They give very good information on how NASA plans to get peopel to Venus by building a space craft that will hover 30 miles over the landscape of Venus. He gives muliple good facts about the spaace craft and how it will possible work. The author claims it will work like airplanes and a blimp, However it will still be hot 30 miles up. It will still be 170 degrees up there.They also give you the bad parts of having a hover craft over Venus for example the visibility of the landscapes and terrian. They also explain how you can't take samples from the ground hovering 30 miles over the land.

The author also gives creat detail of Venuses surface and how NASA has been thinking of diffrent ways to approach it. They give facts about the ground and the atmospherer around Venus and how the Atmosperic pressure is 90 times greatewr then we have experience with.The author also tells us how it's blanketed with 97 percent Carbon diocide and other gasses. We are even told that the conditions are to extream for us and how the presure would crush a submarine.

In the passage he describes how it's one of the brightest points in the sky. The author even tells us how a amerture could even find it. Venus is also described as our twin planet. It is also wrote in the passgae on how close it resembles our planet even though it could crush and kill anyone. The author also adds on how hard Venus is to examine with all the storms and comotion on its ground.

Venus even has volcanoes that erupt on it's surface. It has Earthquakes and even occasional lightning storms. The author has definetly done a very good job on explaining his point on exploring Venus. He has put the good and the bad facts into the passage. He describes almost every aspect of the planet.The author aslo beleives that it will be good for us to try and explore Venus because we will be able to go one more dangerouse trips in the future.",4
067a23d,"The author supported his ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". He explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe he did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. He didnt just focus on one thing he focused on it all and he put his paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how he restated the question that he had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs he learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that he explained both bad and good thing about venus. He sounded like he knew exactly what he was talking about and he knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ",2
067d842,"Many people arent sure what to do when it comes to election. Electoral College is the process that consist of the election. I believe that Electoral College is the easist way to handle the way of voting. Any ways whats wrong with Electoral College almost half the people agree to it.

The founding father that discovered Electoral College made it easy for anybody to be president. Many people also agree with me because according to source 2 it says that in case of the election it will be thrown to the House of Representatives where the delegations vote on the president. This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. On the other hand many people belive that Electoral College is unfair to some people. Many people want to abolish Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be declared the candidate who recives the most popular votes. The electoral restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate. The Electoral college avoids the problem of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

In conclusion I think that Electoral College should stay and it will make things easier for all these reasons I listed from the sources. Also all the presidents will have a chance to become what they want to be.            ",2
681136,"Many believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. There are many conspiracy theories, but scientists say the Face is simply just a natural landofrm. Cydonia was first discovered in May of 2001, and since then has had people baffled by the human-like structure. Though it may be easy to believe that this landform is the creation of aliens on Mars, it is just a natural rock formation on the red planet.

Aliens not been proven to be living in the universe with a secret ancient civilization. Though some people might believe this is untrue, NASA has yet to find evidence to support it. If scientists knew Cydonia was created by aliens, they would definetly want to investigate this further. With this new information, just like any new discovery, it would open up so many different ideas about the universe that do not exist today. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger thatn the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" With the extremely advanced technology we have today, scientists have been able to take more pictures of this landform, further proving that it is a natural creation, and that there is no alien civilization hiding in the depths of it's shadows.

Cydonia has many conflicting opinions on how it was created. Many citizens still strongly hold on to their ideas about this landform. It has been proved by NASA that this formation is not created by aliens, nor is there any living organisms with secret colonies on Mars. People have the choice to believe what they want, but scientists know the truth behind the Face on Mars. ",3
0683ac3,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling by just looking at their face? Now, scientist have discovered a new technology to read emotions. The new technology uses recognition of muscle movements in the face. This new technology would be valubale in a classroom with students because you could tell how the students really feeling, you could tell if they are faking emotions, and it could be a learning tool.

First, you could tell how the students are really feeling. In paragraph 9, the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means if a teacher sees an upset student, the teacher can tell them to make a happy face and eventually the student won't be as upset. It would help everyone be happy because everyone will ""... unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

Second, it would help show if anyone is faking emotions. In paragraph 8, the author says ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would also be helpful with students in a classroom because if student his trying a student is trying to hide being upset a teacher could know and then ask them whats wrong. Also, it would work the other way too. The teacher would know if a student would be faking being upset.

Lastly, it could be used as a learning tool. It could be a way of showing how facial muscles work and the emotions that are shown by them. In paragraph 6, the author states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that it would be able to help students learn based off of their emotions.

There many things in the new technology that would be valuable in a classroom with students. For instance, it help tell how students are feeling. Also it could tell if a student is faking a smile and is really upset. Finally, it would be a helpful learning tool by changing lessons by the students emotions. Next time you see a facial expression try telling what emotion that it applies to.",3
0687af4,"Driverless cars will bring great benefits to the human race. They can provide a level of safety that many people are unable to provide, and they can allow for new freedoms and options for those on the road. They can take people to the hospital if someone is injured, and they can also bring a person to his/her home, if needed. The possibility of driverless cars is slowly becoming a reality, thanks to the work done by various companies. Google has already created a modified car capable of maky of these things, and other auto makers have followed in Google's footsteps. Automated cars will be helpful in the future due to the safety brought by the introduction of promising technology, and the steady progress in the fields of robotics and cars.

The technology used in driverless cars is very advanced, able to process information and respond in the time comparable to a human. They can respond generally better to dangerous situations than that of the human mind as well. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash""(2). These cars are trustworthy in a safety sense, and they know when it is neccessary to give control back to the driver.""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead repuires human skills""(7). This means that not all control is relinquished to the car. Truthfully, most of these driverless cars actually build from a driver assistance system, where the car helps the person drive rather that drive for the person. Automated cars can soon be possible for all of humanity.

Humanity has already come a long way from the past, when people would dream of robotic cars. Car companies have developed technologies that can make those dreams a reality. ""'There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.'"" Nowadays, cars are now able to have their own radar systems. Google modified a car to have a motion sensor, GPS, and four radar sensors. In the future, many automotive companies plan to have their own driverless cars. Tesla plans to have a car by 2016. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan will push to have automated cars by 2020. Progress is already happening in the car industry.

Driverless cars are a possibility for humanity. In the past, people would dream of being able to sit in a automated car. Today, the world's first robotic cars are being produced. There are those who oppose the idea of having a robot drive, but there are results that speak for the effectiveness of driverless cars. In the future, there will be many more automated cars, and there will also be many less deaths and injuries on the roads.",5
0689c67,"The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.

There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.

If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.

They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.

While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.                 ",5

With this new rule in place many things can change and improve. People will actually have to do a little research before voting on a president.

Firstly, Changing to election by popular vote for the president can cause a chain reaction. With this new rule the people of the United States will be forced to do solid research before making a vote that will benifit them. Reason being that with this new rule in place your vote is much more crucial then it was before. Doing this stops people from voting just because they like how someone looks, or because how they dress. The people will be voting because they want a president that will help the country. Using this method will improve and shape the country in an wonderful way.

Lastly, this new rule will cause more people to come out and vote. Because each vote will be ten times more essential then it was before. People come out knowing that if they dont vote, it will have a much bigger impact then it did before. The people are forced to decisions. This make for a healthy country that is made for the people.

Being driven by computer car can be very dangerous, it is not safe to not be driven by someone with a right mind. Computers can't do everything. Why would a human want to be driven by a car instead of a human?

Another thing is that you can help people and make someone happy. Don't you just love the joy you get when you help someone in need? Well you can have that feeling all the time if you volunteer because you are always helping people in need by giving them animals to eat.

For the record, you can see amazing monuments and other amazing things by just volunteering. You get to see these things for free because you have to go to some places like how I saw the Acropolis and I took a grondola ride so that was fun.

Something else is that you can get out of the drafts. I know because when I was on the ship, Iturned 18 and they said to keep going for my service and so that made me happy.

069cd67,"An idea for driverless cars does sound appealing. It can improve the intelligence of today's cars by giving them a mind of their own. However, these cars may seem like a decent idea for the future, but they can prove to be really difficult. Quite a few problems can arise from this phenomenon. The development for these driverless cars should cease pretty soon.

In the future, driverless cars are supposed to become a new thing. These cars will have the ability to function on their own and drive itself, which will not really require the driver to handle it. Although this seems like a nice thought, this is quite an issue already. Creating driverless cars can create laziness in lots of people. Assuming that this creation is titled 'driverless', many people will think that they do not have to do anything. This will raise the laziness in some people if this driverless car becomes available. This invention is not a good idea.

As well as it can raise laziness in people, it can quite possibly cause the driver to use it to his/her advantage in inappropriate ways. There is a law that says the driver must be held responsible for any mistakes he/she makes while on the road whether the car is automated or not. The driver will be at fault regardless if any acident is to happen. Even though this law exists, people will still make excuses for their mistakes. If an accident occurs, the driver may use the car as an excuse to avoid any responsibilities, such as court cases if anything is damaged. With such an invention as great as this, someone is most likely going to use it as a scapegoat for their mishaps. This just gives people a reason to avoid being guilty for what they did.

It is said that the car is supposed to maintain its commands and make driving easier. These driverless cars are supposed to work almost efficiently for everyone. However, accidents are still likely to happen. Even if these cars are supposed to work well, things can go wrong. Perhaps the car may somehow malfunction while on the road. If this happens, it will put the driver and other people on the road, driving or walking, at an extreme risk. If a malfunction in the car is to occur, accident and death rates will increase. This is extremely unsafe for drivers in the future.

It sounds great to have a car that can drive itself in the future. Maybe it might raise the intelligence of some drivers. Nevertheless, the possibilities of this new car going wrong should not be ignored. These cars cannot be 100% perfect at all times after its release.

We have taxi drivers that takes us where we need to go. Another reason is I would rather do it my self is because i enjoy driving, and I would be more than happy to take

myself where I need to go. My last reason about not wanting driverless cars because think about if they malfunction or if someone hacked into your car.

If we had driverless cars, we would be taking alot of peoples jobs that they depend on. Bus drivers, taxi drivers, shofurs would all be out of work and could now be lost in life. Not having anything other work

avalible for them becsuse they didnt go to collage or they just cant find a new job.

Another reason that

I belive we dont need driveless cars is because i enjoy driving and im sure im not the only only. But driverless cars would take the freedom feeling out of driving. Being able to go where you want, how you want, and when you want to. But what if your someone who likes to driver of roads in dirt, mud or any other terrian. The car that drives its self wouldnt do that bc it may be damaged or it may read that its a possibility of that.

My last thought on driverless cars are they have the potential to be very dangerous also its pointless to have one if you still have to be aware as if you were driving. But what if your just like antother day of you letting your car drive itself starts to have defects. A couple of those are that sometimes it rapidly picks up speed and slams on the brakes. Results you end up running someone over or you get into a bad accident. You have to take the blame for the mistake your car made. That could lead to big fines or even Jail time. Or what if someone hacks into your car and takes control of your car and try to hurt you by crashing it or they take you some where your not fimilliar with. As in they driver you out of state and you get lost.

So again I am one that is against driverless cars. they could put people out of work making peoples lifes ruined. It can take the thrill some get from driving. Also alot can go wrong if the car comes with flaws.

We helped so many people affected by the war. We took animals, food supply, and more to people whose countries were left in ruins from bombings, and other attacks of World War 2. So many people, that would have otherwise not have been able to do very well, got animals, food to feed their animals, and food for themselves. Helping them helped me to be more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all that serious though. We would play around on board, usually after all the animals had been unloaded, and we were heading back. We would have baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been kept. Table-tennis, fencing, and boxing were other sports we found a way to play. There were also things like reading, whittling, and games we used to help pass the time.

Along with our jobs, sightseeing was something we did everyday. I got a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. In Greece, I got to do something I think is pretty special. See the Acropolis. In Venice, Italy, I got to take a gondola ride on one of the many streets of water. I also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal on the way to China.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy helped open up the world to me. Instead of being drafted into the military, I got to help people in need all over the world. When my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat, I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, and it really did turn out to be one!   ",3

It is just a rock formation without an alien monument. Landforms are not rare on other planets. Landforms come in all shapes and sizes so it just so happens to be a face.

When the scientist went back up to take picture and look at it more, they were able to take a clear picture of it. The scientist then blew it up to a bigger picture and saw that it was a natural landform.

This can sometimes lead to the student getting even sadder or madder than they were. If they are left alone and no one knows what is wrong, they will be fine.

To start off, expressions can not forsure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The FACS can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy. This means it can make you SLIGHTLY happy but not enough to classify yourself as happy and I do not approve to let people read emotions. It is unnecessary and we should be researching something better than this.               ",2

Venus once had oceans and was covered with structures like valleys and mountains that we have here on Earth. The risk is high, but the reward is even higher.

So all those years we studied mars and it's land's forms to see if there were others that look a like. We didn't find other that look a like so people start to make their own ideas of the face.

Most people though that was made for aliens, but it wasn't. We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land. And one of are partners came with the idea of a natural structure or a mesa. He think in that because if people or aliens live in there it's most be something in there that help us see if they live in there.

NASA send people to see if they could find something in there that may help us, but not.

So we decided to show it to the world because it was just a mesa. People got scared in the start but when they see that there were no aliens they relax and some studious used that for movies, books, etc.

06c3953,"""Face"" the Facts

The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the ""truth"" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing more than a natural landform.

First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it says ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.

Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.

Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.

To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to

In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.

06c7026,"The Face on Mars is just a landmark. I can tell you this because you can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming.

You can't believe anybody that has no real evidence. In paragraph five it says that ""evidence that NASA would rather have."" That shows that NASA doesn't want to say to anybody that is assuming that this is created by aliens because they really want this to be confidential. People thing the face is evidence of life on Mars and the Face is bona fide so they are saying there has to be life on Mars. In reality they don't know what they are saying so they are assuming that this was created by aliens just to start talk and give people something to talk about. This is evidence of why you can't believe anything without true evidence.

NASA won't even leak anything. Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that. This is evidence of why NASA won't leak anything so people do not know the truth.

If NASA won't leak anything then everyone is just assumimg. ""The Face on Mars has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" It has been in movies okay and they change it up a little bit to make it interesting and people think that is the true story. NASA wishes there was ancient civilization background on Mars so they know the full details. NASA doesn't even know the full story of the The Face, so how can people be for sure about anything. These are examples of why people are just assuming.

People think it is a face that aliens put on there. So you are saying if I go out to the middle of the desert and see a face it camre from aliens. It is a natural landmark that came with the planet of Mars. NASA is not even telling people so no one even knows for sure anyways.

You can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming. This is why this is just a landmark. There is a lot of landmarks on earth and this is one of them on Mars. There is no evidence of any of this so don't believe what everybody says.              ",3
06c7ba1,"Everyday technology is changing for the better. There is a lot of contriversy about cars. Wheather they should be driverless or not. I belive that it is not a good idea for the cars to be driverless. I think this becuase humans are smarter, technology fails sometimes, and it will be too expensive. The idea of cars being driverless is scary.

Firstly, I believe that humans are smarter than any computer in the world. Humans know what is going on whereas computers dont know as much. comeputers can fail to sense something and get in bad accidents. Drivers also have better senses, computer can always fail. I belive that humans should be the only ones driving the cars.

Another reason that i think cars should not be driverless, is becuase technology always fails. What if one of the sensors fail and you loose control of the car. The artilce said that the cars arn't fully driverless, so what is the point. Also, computars can glitch and cause horrible accidents. technonlgy is not very reliable.

lastly, another reason why cars shouldn't be driverless is becuase it would cost a a lot of money. Cars will have many sensors and devises that are very expensive. The roads will also need to have some senors in them and that will cost a fortune. the cars will also need a lot of energy to keep all the sensors running, which will mean that the battery will need to be changed constantly, and batterys arn't very cheap. I belive that it will cost to much money to make the driverless car.

In conclusion, I belive that driverless cars shouldn't be made. Driverless cars will cost toom much, humans are smarter, and technology is not reliable. Driverless cars will cause alot of debt and accidents. It is pointless to make them if the driver will always need to be there taking the wheel. So the cars are not completely driverless. Driverless cars are not a good idea.      ",3

This sentece is telling the reader the truth right then and there. The face infact is formed by a natural landform, a mesa which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 2 it tells us, the readers, that scientists figured the face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia but only had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. In paragraph 8 it gives a reasonn on why maybe the alien markings showed up on the face. The camera that took the photograph of the face had to peer through a wispy cloud to see the face. Perhaps the alien figures had been caused by the cloudy surface. In paragraph 6 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, "" We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim was still trying to get the truth to the people after 18 years long of the Viking mission ended. Althoug targeting Cydonia was not easy, on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team from Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia flew and took a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos.

06cf397,"There are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage, like it will help lower green house gases, it will help save money, and its a great way to get exercise.

Don't get me wrong I love driving and all but it's effecting our ecosystem. Just think if one day out of every week we rode our bikes, or we car pooled, or we took the bus think of how much smog would go away. In source 2 it talks about how they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave there cars at home same went for odd-numbered licence plates the following day. With in five days sixty pecent of the smog was cleared. And they only did it for five days, imagine if every city in the world did this once a month. In source one it states that passenger cars are responsible fro twelve percent of green house gas emisssions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some parts of the United States. In source one it also talks about a city in Germany named Vauban. Vauban is a city that has banned cars. There is a main thoroughfare , where the tram runs to downtown Freiburg, and and a ffew streets on the edge of the community but ther e are only two places to park-large garadges on the outside of town. And it cost 40,000 dollars along witha home. If we had cities like this here in the U.S. it would be so much better and there wouldnt be so much pollution.

By limiting the usage on cars it will help save money. Think if you walked or rode you're bike to work everyday then you wouldnt have to pay for gas. Gas is tipically three to four dollars so if you wanted to put thirty gallons of gas in you car it could cost you ninety dollars. Thats a lot of money to spend on gas and thats not even a full tank for some people. Sure if you ride you bike to work everyday you might have to fix it but you're gonna have to fix your car at some point to and bike parts are so much cheaper than car parts so you'd be saving money there too. And if you walked you would'mt have to even worry about fixing your bike. It might take you longer to get to where you need to go but think you'll be saving money and the Earth. You don't even have to ride your bike or walk, you can car pool or take the bus. You still have to pay for the bus but its way cheaper than paying for gas.

If you're limiting your car usage and walking or riding your bike to work everyday, which maens you'll be getting exercise. Most people don't get the exercise they need so by limiting your car usage not only are you helping the environment you're getting the daily exercise you need. Even if you're riding the bus you're gonna have to get to the bus stop some how. And they even have a place to put your bike on the bus so if the bus does'tn take you all the way to where you need to go you can ride your bike the rest of the way.

So limiting your car usage is'nt all that bad. I mean I don't know anyone who does'nt want to help eliminate green house gases, save money and get exercise while doing it.    ",4

06d6248,"Would you want to be burned at 800 degrees Fahrenheit? No, that just sound to painful you might say. Scientists at NASA speculate that Venus's surface on the planet can average those temperatures. In this essay I will talk about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and evidence that backs my claim up thoroughly.

Going to another planet seems so dangerous and so far out of our mind that we don't think about this idea on a regular basis. The text states in paragraph 3, ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures avereage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encouter on Earth."" This quote shows how much more dangerous Venus is than Earth just simply based on the atmosphere of the planet and that harsh conditions that cover it. Another piece of evidence is this in paragraph 4, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such asn valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of Venus seems indisputable."" This quote shows how Venus is so close geographically and distance wise to Earth based on some land features. Researchers find that getting even 30 miles from the surface of the planet the temperatures would still be at roughly 160 degrees Fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to Earth's sea level.

Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is so magnificant of a planet because we have never experienced a planet so much like our own. Our travels shouldn't be limited by dangers or doubts that we may have but should meet our endeavourous wonders and imagination of the planet and travel.    ",3

Plus candidates don't even spend their times in the places they know they would have no chance of focusing on the tight races in the states or in no chance of winning. The electoral college is practically unfair, outdated, and irrational. I mean the electoral college can have some good outcomes such as the non democratic method of selecting the president that would be overruled. When you're voting for an electoral college you're actually voting for a slate of electors. They usually avoid the problems of the elections in which none of the candidate gets a majority of the votes that are casted. In some states they know their votes will have no effects. The most thoughtful people that vote should be the ones that decide the election.

Electoral college are retained because of its lack of democratic pedigree, all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative. Elections are only a few of voters away from catastrophe. In elections there could be ties, deadlocks, in Hawaii they had voted the other way. Their are many campaigns about 17 states didn't see the candidates at all including South Carolina, a lot of voters didn't get to see campaign ads. Some win the popular votes but lose the presidency. About 60 percent of the people prefer a direct election from what we have now.

Voters that are now in the presidential elections are people who want to express the political preferences rather than to have people who think single votes can decide an election. Winner-take-all method of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates. Some other things begin equal, a large state gets more attention from the presidential candidates in campaigns than a small state.                    ",2

Luke couldn't say no so, he went with him for an opportunity of a life time.

In 1945, World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. 44 nation joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitatiion Administration ). After that the UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young farm animals that were shipped overseas. When luke turned 18 years old right before he arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. In 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy was ever been through.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a smal- town boy, Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luke also found time to have fun on board, esspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played music, played games, sports they played, and also read to have some relaxation.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy for Luke was much more an adventure for him it also gaved him much more experience to the world than he imagined. It made Luke more aware of peole of other countries their needs. and that awareness stayed ith him, leading his family to host a number of international student and exchanged visitors for many years.

This is why we need you to be in our program have exiting adventures just like Luke Bomberberger did when he was an adult. You can have the fun to if you want to have unique visit to places. please come join us with this program and have your lifetime adventurre with all the food suplies, games, reading and more so, leave your stuff at home and, come have the fun and exiting trips, visit with our program.

Participate at the Seagoing Cowboy's program at anytime and everyday. Be like Luke Bomberberger when he claimed his life with experience and, adventures.   ",2
06e2db4,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.

When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.

The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.

As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.

Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom.

06ed983,"In the aricle ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. Details I found from in the article show that computers can read a persons emotions. It can also tell from a painting or a video. It tells us in the beginging of the paragraph 1 that in the Mona Lisa paiting it shows emotion. According to the new computer software that can read emotions they tested it on paiting. She shows 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 perecent ferful, and 2 percent angry.

I believe this new technology is valuable for our use. It can give us bettter ways to explore and to communicate with computers. It tells us in the artilcle that computers can actually ""calculate"" emotions. It can recognize how a human feels and how humans express themselves. A psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman a creator for FACS constructed a 3-D computer model of a face and all major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. One or more muscles that move is called a ""action unit"". An example, your pfrontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyues) raise your eyuebros when your surprised or shocked .

Using video imagery, the new emotion-regonition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. Humans perform this same impressice ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her or his face. I think to read the emotional expressions of students in classroom is impressive. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It could also make computer animated faces more clear and expressive for video games video surgery. But also most humans communicate in nonverbal, including emotional communicaton.

I think the use to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable. It can help them in the classroom if there confused or distracted. It could really help a lot more then just students in a classroom. I think it could be used around in daily life maybe at a hostpital or military. This is why i think the Facial Action Coding System and technology is valuable.            ",3
06ef6d4,"Many people think that the Face that was discovered on Mars might have been created by aliens. But thats far from the truth. There are many reasons why that face could have shown up there. A natural lanform maybe? Mesa? Anything but aliens.

Although there is no evidence for there being life on Mars, many skeptics say otherwise. We believe that is was just a natural lanform that was mistaken for looking like a face because the landform gives off the illusion of having eyes and a mouth. Its unusual shadow is believed to only be a mesa and many people are fascinated with it.

Some people counter will be you are hiding it because you dont think the people of the United States can handle it, or it can be too dangerous for us to comprehend. This all could be good reasons not to tell but, considering the fact that there was not evidence of life, how can there be some sort of alien? My rebuttal to these claims are it just had happened naturally and everything is going just going how it was made to be and NASA haf found positive and reasonable points that it was just made naturally.

We have different landforms made everyday and the come out looking rather unusual but that doesnt mean that there is anything out there that is capable of reaching us. If the skeptics are so sure that that was made with the possiblilities of there being aliens on Mars, then they need the statistic and evidence to support why.",3
06fa3b6,"Do you remember when the weather was mild with a slight breeze and you could go and just drive with the windows for about a year? Imagine be able to do that in a car that doesn't need your help to drive. Wouldn't it be nice to have that? I think it would and in the near future it might just be possible. They has been several motor compinies that are on tract to have a driverless model out in the year 2020.

The more you think about being able to absorb nature in a car the better it sounds. Think about driving around the Grand Canyon or taking a tour around Times Square in New York. Both seem like fun places to visit but when you are driving around rocks and trying to avoid clif edges or focusing on the traffic in front of you that may take an hour just to move one block, now that doesn't seem that enjoyable. Now in the future there is a possinbility that you could still do these things, still be in the drivers seat, but be able to look around and enjoy the sereny because your car drives itself.

Now you might be thinking that this is very dangerous and right now at this present moment it may be. However, with the way technology is advancing and the ability we have with it, driverless cars might be safer than cars driven by humans. Us humans have a tendency to always make mistakes and some of those mistakes cause injury and even death when we come to talk about motor vehicle mistakes. There has been plenty of fatal accidents casued by people not paying attetion or drinking and then trying to drive drunk which is one the stupidest mistakes someone could make in their lifetime. With the driverless car these mistakes can easily be prevented. No more do we have to not only focus on the road in front of ourselves but also to the area around us because the majority of driving is defense driving and watching out for other people. WIth these cars you don't have to worry about weather the car next to you is going to try to cut you off or if the person heading the opposite direction is going to veer off and speed into your lane. All of these cars have sensors and can detect what is around them, where they are going, when to stop, and when to go.

These cars are the cars of the future. They will be installed with the best and latest safety equipment. They will change the way of our everyday life. They will change the way we travel. These cars are coming and coming fast, they maybe be expensive at first but it won't take long before everyone has them. They may seem like a tale from a movie or a book, but they will be here before you know it , weather you are ready or not.",3
070faae,"Technology is a great thing to have in a classroom. It helps kids in many ways. It helps being able to know when a kid is struggling and the computer can go back and help the kid. The computer can do many different things. It could help with their homework. Being able to use a computer is a nice thing to have especially in the classroom, because a teacher isn't always going to be there for the child that has a question. Technology could be very productive too. Most kids like being able to use technology instead of pencil and paper. Kids engage more when they use computers.

Technology is a great resource is the classroom to have because it is hard for kids to pay attention. If you have a computer software that could recognize emotions it would help with what you need to help the kid with more. All the computer would have to do is be able to have a wide understanding of subtle facial movements with a 3-D computer model of the face. The software would have an understanding of all the 44 major muscles in the model that would need to move like the way the muscles do in a human face.

I'm very supportive with technology being used in the classroom, because if a kid cannot write it could potentially be easier for a kid if he were to type it. If a child were to have trouble than it would pick up on it from the child's facial reaction. In Paragraph six it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomeing confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" It could be more beneficial than a teacher, because for the kids who do understand it they can move onto other things and the kids who don't can have extra help.

Most humans show facial expressions toward someone instead of verbal communication. Paragraph six Dr. Huang said that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" Most people could have a benefit to this so that they could understand the assignment they're assigned for the lab they could be doing for a science class. It just all depends on whether or not the kid would use this tool effectivly as others. It could be used as a lie detector in a way if it picks up any facial expressions.

This facial recognition can be very benefital for the kids who struggle on watching a video over how to do something. The 3-D will calculate the kids who are struggling with a problem or anything that is assigned to them. This strategy is very useful for when kids don't have any help or when the teacher is helping someone else it can help and walk the kid through the problem instead of having them get upset, because the computer can detect anything that happens to the kid while in the process of the lesson. Technology is a very useful thing for kids who struggle, become upset, or have trouble understanding.",3

07122f0,"There are many different plants in our solar system. You may have a favorite one or maybe you're just not that interested in it. Well have you ever thought about taking a trip to the moon or just the planet period maybe even studying a planet just for fun? It will cause you to think about the 5 w's first the who, who will be there are there lots of humans just floating around in space? what will it be like, what would it look like? Why did someone create this?

when did everything take place? Why did it take place? Where did everything all begin And what made someone think of this ?

Let's say you studied Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planted in our solar system. It could be by far the most exiciting plant that you could ever study and the greatest dangerous one too. Beyond high pressure and heat Venus geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Venus causes many things to corrupt without venus there would be many corruptions in the world. But so does any other planet right? Not every planet is a good planet.

How is Venus tested and when was it discorved ? According to the text,"" Many astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planted in our solar system"" The text also states that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. "" Different plantes have been here for over 1,000 years crazy right, If you was to imagine what life would be like with out planets or gravity keeping everything in check what would we be up to right now. We need these things to survive.

Venus could be the most by far dangerous planet to visit the text says ,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". The text also states that, "" On the plantet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This goes to show that if you were able to take a trip to Venus you probaly would pass out or either die because the tempature is not average compared to the Earth's and there's less oxygen.

You might take it into concederation that we should not be limited to on things we want to do just because the danger of things, and I agree because the world be so much better if we did what we wanted. Studying a planet and actually going to see about it could be someone's biggest dream but they are stopped by it because of the outcome. Many people say chase your dream but how if we stuck in the same mind frame as everyone else.      ",2
719241,"I will be writing about why you should paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will include details from the story. Also reasons to join the program. the last thing i will include is examples from the text.

My frist reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is just to experiance new things. You should not be on your phone all day doing nothing. Get up and at least try to have a little bit of fun. if you have never been there or even heard of it how do you know it is going to be boring. You never know until you drop your phone and actually join. You might end up having some fun.

A second reason is well look what Luke Bomberger did. He joined 44 nations to form unrra (the united nations relief and rehabilitation). UNRRA took care of horses, young cows, and mules that wers shipped overseas. Wouldnt you want to spend your days with nice and loving animal that wont hurt you. You never know, if no one joins Seagoing Cowboys then maybe there could have been animals who were in dangered, or might be extinct. I think that animal are really fun to hang out with.

The last and final reason is you dont just take care of animals but you help the places that were dastroyed because of world war II. It would be great if you actually got to see where many people were fighting, got killed, injured, or much more in world war II. Just like Luke in the story, you can also go to may places that he went like new orleans, or greece. This is your oppertunity to visit beautiful places that you have never been to before. You could also meet new people.

To summarize everything up those are some reasons why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. You just never know until you try it out.   ",3

And on the planet;s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

These facts that you can research are very true because you could go up there and find out all theses stuff and these facts support my claim because you can research cool stuff about Venus and that other people didn't know about and thats how it supports my claim.

These are just some of my reasons to join now!

I also got to see alot of things on th trips I went on, nine to be exact. On a trip to China I got to see the great and Marvelous Panama canal! Venice a beatifull city with steets of water was one of my stops. These are sights some only wish on going and wouldn't imagine anyone passing that up!

In my conclusion I would like to say it's not without its risks. I almost fell off the ship once but some metal caught me and I wassafe. You also attend the animals on board the ship and clean the Stalls or else it would stink bad. Other than that you have that feeling in you that you made a right choice.

071de41,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" a technology called Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies. This would allow people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another. Being able to know how someone feels helps to complement those emotions. If a classmate was feeling happy, sad, angry, or any other emotion, and it was known it would be much easier to know how to approach them than it would be without the knowledge showing why this infromation could be valuable.

Knowing how another person feels makes it less difficult to communicate with them and communication is important in a classroom. In the text the author talked about how the program could tell when a person is not truly conveying emotions.

The text says,""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

This information is useful to a classroom because it shows the true emotions or feelings of someone. If a student in a classroom said ""I understand"", but did not truely mean it a teacher could use this information to know that more teaching may have to be done for students to fully understand the topic being taught.

Another example from the text says,""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This quote from the text explains that there are many different ways to express emotion and because of this it may be harder for everyone to fully understand how someone feels based on facial expression. That is why this technology could be valuable so that everyone is fully understood and proper treatment can be given to complement emotions.

Things should change in a classroom when students feel unconnected to what is going on, but it is not easy for everyone to know just when students may feel out of place. A quote from the text says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Here in the text the article talks about the technology being able to tell when a student is bored and confused, and then being able to modify a lesson effectively.

With this technology students would gain a full understanding of a topic without needing to ask because of facial expressions. This would be very effective in a classroom as it makes sure that everyone gets to learn the way that they need to.

The text also says,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too."" This quote explains that not all communication is verbal and most is actually nonverbal.

This means that listening may not always be enough and it is important to see and feel how others feel proving why this technology can help a classroom.

By reading faces the technology can help convey one's feelings to another to help gain a full understanding.

By understanding how someone else feels it makes it easier to understand them.

The article says,""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

This quote talks about empathy and how it is important in knowing how to treat people. Using this in a classroom could helpl classmates and teachers get along better.

The use of facial recognition technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies.

This helps people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another.

728321,"The Aliens on Mars

In the text Unmasking the Face on Mars NASA says that there was a face.Then they went back eighteen years later.Then another three years and said it was a natural landform.I also think that it is a natural landform because there isn't really aliens or anything other living thing on mars.Some people would there are lifeforms on Mars because of water which is ridiculous.There could be clouds and water on a planet without a lifeform. In these next few paragraphs i will tell you why it is a natural landform.

One reason that the so called face is only a landform is because it could've been a rock formation.There could be rocks in the shape of a head because of other rocks and erosion.And how the got the eyes?...shadows.Shadows could've been a be part of this because its a planet pretty close to the sun.So from which way the Viking 1 was facing there could've been shadows.

Second reason is on April 5,1998 when they went to mars again with Mars Global Surveyor...while thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting the image JPL wedsite revealed it as a natural landform. People were upset so they said since it was a cloudy haze there could still be a face.Which made it worse because people actually believed that.

Third reason is if there was a face form on earth and no one would freak out by it because there is actual humans on earth.So if there were aliens everyone would freak.Am I right?So if there were real aliens you wouldnt know what they actually look like but you do know from evidence from ""actual pictures"" that people supposedly took.

Some people think its the other way around.Some people who aren't like me actually believe in aliens.They think since in 2001 they sent a better camera on a ""cloudless"" day that there were Martians.And since they have the camera whith better pixels they could see more clearly...so clearly that you could've have seen Egyptian style pyramids or even a small shack which was almost impossible in the Viking 1.

To conclude, I think that the face was a natural landform made by erosion.It would most likely to be impossible for it to be a martian, not saying it is but I highly doubt there would be martians.",4
072c8a3,"I think that it is a neat idea to have driverless cars but only if all of the things that could go wrong have been evaluated. I can also tell you that they will never work out everything that could go wrong no matter how much they think they have. What if there is a malfunction and the car swerves and drives off of a cliff. That wouldn't be the drivers fault it would be caused by faulty technology. There would have been nothing that the driver of the vehicle could have done to prevent that from happening. What happens if one of these cars runs into another car because the technology stopped working. As stated in the passage would it be the drivers fault or the manufacturer.

You have to keep all of these things that could go wrong in mind you can't just think about the upsides of these smart cars. It would be neat to have a car drive for you i'll admit that and that is amazing that we're working on something that can do that and that we have became that technologically developed. There is just many things that need to be taken into consideration. There are so many ways someone could get hurt in something like this smart car. I think it would just be safer to not have these type of cars out and about on the street. What if they malfunctioned and ran a pedestrian over and neither the person in the car or the pedestrian walking would have seen it coming. There are already so many people being killed by drunk drivers now a days. I think achieving the development of this kind of technology would just make the death rate go up and this world doesn't need that happening it is already heart breaking how many people die in a day already.

People should not have to dread walking around if they do not have a vehicle just because they fear of this technology hitting them. They would have to take the necessary precautions in order to have this kind of technology on the streets. I don't think that the developers think of all the dangerous things that could happen by having these cars. They all just think of how cool it would be to drive a smart car. Well I can tell you that I think that to many people die from drunk drivers or people that aren't paying attention to where they are going when they are driving around. Yeah were still going to have people die from these things. We don't however need there to be more people dying because of faulty technology.

They can think that they have worked every kink out in their technology but, I can assure you that they haven't. There is always going to be a risk of something happening with this kind of technology. It's not just safe because the manufacturers say that it's safe that is just not how it works. All i'm saying is that we should be more concerned with what could go wrong than what is cool. I would rather be safe walking on a sidewalk then not wanting to leave because im scared of dying. I think that we just need to stop being lazy it's just steering a steering wheel it's not rocket science.",3

073d5b0,"""New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others."" I believe that this software is very interesting because it detects your facial expressions through a screen and tries to understand your emotions. However, I do not think that we need this software in our schools for education purposes.

There are a few reasons in which I believe that these programs should not be installed on our school computers. The text claims that ""the computer could modify a lesson, like a human instructor.""

However, I find this hard to believe considering the software can not specifically determine what lessons or problems you do not understand. One for instance, if a student is supposedly confused or bored, he or she can ask the teacher for help. If we have a school computer that modifies and changes the lesson due to facial expressions, it might get in the way and misunderstand what we actually need help with or slow us down. Recieving specific help from teachers, to understand the certain steps that a student struggles with would be a better option in my opinion.

Secondly, we do not know how accurate this software is. The program could be very touchy; It could mix up confusion for anger. The student could be upset about a different topic or could simply have a certain resting face. The accuracy could have a lot to do with how this program would help us.

Lastly, Why spend a lot of money installing programs to hundreds of computers at our school when we can recieve help from our teachers?

Teachers are there to answer specific questions and a software that only detects your facial expressions and matches them to emotions can not do that. Installing these programs to our school computers will cost the school a lot of time and money without knowing for a fact that this software will actually be useful. Given these ideas, I do not think that it would be a very helpful addition to our students to install this software.                           ",4
742654,"Kids across America probably know someone who looks or acts like they are depressed, but when they ask what is wrong they usually say they are fine or nothing is wrong and they will try to continue their day. Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.    ",2
0746d1a,"There are some good and bad examples in this article. It is a easy side to choose weather you want to agree or disagree with the development of theses cars. The side I would have too choose is not to agree with the development of these cars.

I would have to disagree because if i'm driving down the road and the car stops working because of an accident that happened. Who's fault is it? Like the article said, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the maufacture?"" If it is the cars fault, the driver would be aloud to sue for the faulty of the car. If it was the drivers fault, then they would have to pay for the damage they have caused.

What would happen if the sensors in the car stop working, in the middle of the person driving? Let's say you're driving down the road, the car in front of you slams on their breaks because of a read light. Your car can't stop because of the sensors are not working, you can't take control because the car has control to stop you. You skid down the road, hitting the other car. What happens next?

In conclusion, before they start selling these cars, they could at least take more time fixing the things that go wrong. Would you want to have something go wrong with the car, then it be your fault? They could try something new if they can't seem to fix the problem. Or maybe they should just stop trying to take away some of the driving privliges from the customers. This is not a good idea for the future. It could go wrong in so many ways.",2

Many people would not want a computer looking at them to see their facial expression to determine what they like or what they dislike. Many people can often pull of a fake expression that is good enough for a computer to calculate, like in paragraph seven, which includes instructions on how to do a real smile compared to a fake smile.

Most people cover up cameras on their laptops,computers, and phones for privacy and safety. Anyone who would cover up their camera would most likely not want their face constantly being scanned to tell emotion or what they like and dislike.

In paragragh seven, the article briefly explains how to look happy, which anyone can do to fool an emotion scanner. Computers are often accurate, but only do what is coded and not anything else. If you were to always be happy but not look happy, the Facial Action Coding System would not be something useful for you or students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System can have many flaws in its design and would not be useful for students in a classroom. It may be innaccurate and not scan correctly or not be used at all for safety and privacy. there are many ways that the Facial Actions Coding System would not be useful and would not help students learn, just show how they feel about some things like websutes and ads.",3
074b43d,"Would you want to keep the Electoral College or change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States? I would want to keep the Electoral College. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it keeps its process organized, it helps people vote, and it helps people out. If i were you id pick to keep the Electoral College. So let me tell you why you should pick to keep the Electoral College.

First of all, you should pick the Electoral College because it keeps the process organized. If you didnt have the Electoral College than you'd probably be confused about a lot of things. You wouldnt know where to go to vote. Also you probably wouldnt know where the section of the electors is. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. If you didnt have the Electoral College you wouldnt know anything of that, so pick to keep the Electoral College.

Second of all, you should pick to keep the Electoral College because it helps people vote. If it wasnt for electors you probably wouldnt be picking a President or none of that because the electors set it all up. The Electoral College tells you where the meeting is to vote. The Electoral College has 538 electors and there has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect a president. So there is no reason not to pick to keep the Electoral College.

Third of all, it helps people out. It helps people out by telling them what to do, where to go, and who to vote for. If there wasnt an Electoral College it would be harder to vote. If its in the Constitution that means it will help you. The Founding Fathers put it there for a reason. So if i were you id pick the Electoral Collge i wouldnt pick to change the election by popular votes for the president of the United States.

Last but not least, I think you should pick to keep the Electoral College because it keeps its process organized, it helps people vote, and it helps people out. Why would you pick to change the election by popular votes? What good is gonna happen? Nothing. It would be better to pick to keep the Electoral College. So you should without a doubt pick the Electoral College.    ",3

They headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece which ment he could be drafted for military service. By the time Luke was discharge in 1947,Luke had made nine trips- the most of any seagoing cowboy.

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.Helping out on his aunt's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, not the dangers at sea. Luke also found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboy played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals were house. Table -tennis tournament, fencing, boxing, reading, whillting, and games also helped pass the time.

074fd98,"Many people in the world today are quite desperate to see change in their life. They are seeking a better life, something new and fun, and to do it for cheap. Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting from your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost non-exsistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, ""in German suburb, life goes on without cars"" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars from the road is by removing parkig lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.

Any doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting from one place to another will require another means fr transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the enviorment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power.

The cars use half of the fuel of today's taxis. It's told that the cars have drivin more than half a million miles without even crashing. The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars by your position on driverless cars.

Reading this article i'm not sure if i'm against it of not. Things that

ran through my head when they asked,"" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore"". Well the thing that I thought about were like Why? I dont really see the purpose of these cars at all. I mean yes, it would be nice from people bussiness people that have to drive thousands of miles each day. For the people just living and normal life like driving to the store or to a friends house, I dont see why they would need them. Is it really as safe as they say it is? Now as I think about the driverless cars more and more, I think i'm going to say that I am against the driverless cars.

I would understand why people would be for the driverless cars. They won't have to drive their kids everywhere, They won't need to worry about drinking and driving, and they won't have to worry about falling asleep while driving. Yes, those are all good resons but they should know already not to do that stuff. I think it's just a way for people to become more and more lazier each day.

760842,"Many people think or believe that they should get rid of the Electoral College vote for the president. Well in my opinion I believe they should not keep it because why do we even need them for? We have the people of the US. They can vote for a president, that's why the Constitution was written, to gives us the rights, freedom of speech, the right to vote. Why else would we have that if our vote won't really matter.

They should get rid of the Electoral College Vote because we already have many people voting for the president. We don't really need many people just to choose one man or woman to lead the country. They can just count how many citizens voted for a president and the one who has more voters is the winner. If it ends up as a tie, then just let the memebers of the House of Represenatives vote. Or at least let the popular vote decide who the president will be.

Having the Electoral College vote is useless, because they just vote for a for a slate of electors, who in turn will elect the president. It just adds more steps to elect the president. They should just get rid of it and keep the popular vote for the president of the United States. Let the qualified citizens vote who they want to be the president. It'd make more sense, because they just vote for someone who is not holding office,  anyone. I say get rid of it so that we don't get a ""disaster factor"" anymore. That 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century.  This electoral college vote is unfair , outdated, and irrational. its unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

However, many people may disagree. They belive that we should keep the electoral college vote. There's five reasons of why they think we should keep this type of method of choosing the President. The first reason is the certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely to happen than a dispute over the popular vote. The second reason is everyone's president. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal and no region has enough electoral votes to elect for a president.  The third reason is the swing states. The unfair method of winner-takes-all electoral votes induces the candidates and focuses on the voters in toss-up states whom more likely pay close attention to the campaign. The fourth reason is the big states. Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance by letting a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. And the fifth reason is to avoid run-off elections. It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

So in conclusion they should get rid of the electoral college vote because its unfair to the small states. Knowing that their vote will not have any effect, they have no reason to pay attention to the campaign. They can just let the popular vote decide or the House of Representatives. Bob Dole was right. Lets get rid of the electoral college vote. Mostly get rid of it because its unfair to some states or people. Its is really an irrational way to settle on an agreement of who the president may be. And yes is may have less disputes over the outcome but it better to have some dispurtes over it so we elect the correct president and see what all their qualities may be. In my opinion I believe we should abolish the electoral college.                                         ",3

Driverless cars will cause a panic. We will never be certain if the car is functioning correctly and will doubt whether we are safe or not. How can we be so sure the car will not malfuntion and crash? Thats the thing, we cant be sure and will always be doubtful of what may happen. In passage 7 it states "" But all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" By telling us this it is saying that the car is still unable to do all task that a normal human can do

The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. By using driverless cars as a taxi system, gas consumption would majorly decrease. The taxi system idea could also lead to new ways of public transportation. These cars could take their passengers anywhere they needed to go through a direct route. Passengers would no longer have to wait for long periods of time on buses for their stops. These driverless systems would allow for greater flexibility overall.

Driverless cars would also help communities everywhere with safety. Since these smart cars are loaded with sensor technology, they can help limit the amount of crashes that were regularly happening. The protypes of driverless cars have gone millions of miles without crashes and could help stunt the commonality of vehicular crashes and deaths. Driverless cars could also aide with the safety for learning and elderly drivers. Oftentimes, teenage drivers and drivers with slow reaction times are the causes of accidents that could have been avoided with easy assistance. Smart, semi-driverless cars could be the answer to these costly problems.

0767c85,"In my opinion, the Electoral College is not an appropriate respresentation of the people's opinions. It is true that the popular vote determines the representative, but that does not mean that all citizen's views are expressed. Many citizens have stopped voting because of the ignorance that is the Electoral College. One should not vote for someone they do not know to represent their lives in the federal government.

The Electoral College might be the easiest way to contract a solid vote from American citizens, but laziness is definitely not efficient. If we want our country running smoothly and in a way that every citizen is comfortable with, everyone needs to be represented. Many citizens will start voting when they hear that they wont be pummelled with propaganda about politicians who think they know about what the people want. They will be elated to hear that they will actually be heard. They will actually make a difference in their country. The common people must be represented, not just advertisements. The conflict between upper and lower class will end because both will be able to make a difference in the minimum wages and tax increases.

Changing the election process to the popular vote would not only represent all people, but cut out the extremes. All politicians must say whether they are a Democrat or a Republican. With popular vote, we can go in depth to what the people really want. Like how gun restraints only go to an extent, so should the poeple's views. Most citizens aren't completely Republican or completely Democratic, and that's alright. There are the conditions in between that need to be addressed.

Coming from a centrally liberal family, I think that all elections through the Electoral College are hoaxes. The representatives of the College and even the president are picked a long time beforehand. The government wants to brainwash the citizens to slowly turn us onto their side. Even if the government rigs the votes but says that the result is completely dependant on the people, it will still belate citizens and get them to participate more in the voting process.    ",3

A seagoing cowboy is someone who takes care of animals that are shipped over sea. Then brings them to the people that need help since the war ruined their food supply or cattle.

It is kinda hard to care for the animals but its not to much of a challenge. I used to help out on my aunts farm all the time and that gave me some experience. It also is a little disgusting to clean the stalls the first time but I pulled through it and eventually I got used to it. My favorite part has to be traveling when i get some free time its fun to go sight seeing.

As a seagoing cowboy you go all around the world and visit amazing places but there are sad moments aswell. When I found out that people other than me are being affected by the war and some are suffering worse, that opened up my eyes. I thought to myself thats why I joined the seagoing cowboys after all not just because I wanted to see the world but also to help people in need.

Lastly being a seagoing cowboy isnt just an adventure its much more. Its part of our future. We need to help everyone in the world through this hard time. Being a seagoing cowboy will help do that. Please consider the offer and sign up.                      ",3
778075,"Have you ever thought what venus could actually do and what it contains good or bad effects? Well acccording to the article there is various reasons why it can be worthy despite the dangers it presents. Venus is sometimes refered to as the evening star it is one of the brightess points of light in the dark sky. It is also the second planet from our sun. In the article it says that "" venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth"". It is still good to study it though so you can know more information about it

Altough venus may seem to be good it can present different types of dangers. In paragraph three the first sentence it says that ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus"". This isnt good it makes the conditions bad and this is something that the humans never encountered before on earth. This could have bad results such as an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustimed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans nad it says it could also liquefy many metals.

Learning and knowing about venus is important so you not only you know about it but what it also contains the pros and cons. Knowing the value of it and what it conatins is important.

In conclusion, is why these reasons is important to know about Venus.You can know about whats happening and if something occurs you now know why. Venus has its own value and ""human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.    ",2
077acd9,"Do you think that there are advantages to limiting car usage? Yes, I do think that there are advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution. There are many advantages of having limited car usage. This includes many different transportations and because of car culture.

To begin with, there are advantages to limited car usage because of pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog, the smog rivale Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gas. Diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines. Paris has more smog than other European capitals.

To continue, there are advantages to limited car usage because of many different acts of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia a program is set to spread to other countries. It was called a ""Car Free"" day which meant that you could not use your car for a whole day. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the  streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

Furthermore, there are advantages to limited car usage because of Car Culture. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions is to shift in American behavior. Research studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The United States has long been one of the world's prime car cultures. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" says Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation

Research Institute. The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.

In conclusion, there are many different advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution, many different acts of transportation, and because of Car Culture.               ",3
077cf8e,"What are your thoughts on the face? Well I think that it was created by aliens. How is that even possible, how can you belive that the face was created by aliens. Well how could you possibly think that it is a humans face, thats impossible. When the team snapped a picture ten times more clear than the original Viking photos, and

When NASA posted the picture on a website, it revealed that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, also proving that it was not an alien monument in the first place.

But still after proving that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, still not everybody was satisfied. Some people still think that since it was cloudy at that time of the year, the camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy, white, and fluffy clouds to be able to see the face. Skeptics were still saying, ""Perhaps the alien marking were conseled by the wispy clouds.

NASA decided to go back to Mars on April 8, 2001, MGS came close enough to get a second look. The team captured an extraodinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resoultion.

I will also be able to tell you how well the author supports his idea. Which is by, out of all the other paragraphs, he is actually writing all the main ideas and supporting his claim and idea in this whole artical. Also in paragraph 5 it says, ""The national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"". Also in paragraph 3 it says, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". Plus, in paragraph 4 it states that (or askes that), ""If our sister planet is so in hospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface?"". In paragraph 1 it states that, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Venus,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple to evem an amature stragazer to spot'. Noe in paragraphn 2 it says that, ""Often reffered to as earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" So now in paragraph 6, it states that ""However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safley far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rending standards forms of photography amd videography ineffective."" Plus, in paragraph 7 it states that, ""NASA is working on other aprroaches to studing Venus.""

078120d,"The author makes a very strong statement when he says we should explore Venus. The author finds the exploration to be worthy of NASAs time. As dangerous as it may be, exploring Venus would determine whether or not it could be a new home for the human race and all other sources of life. It would be a significant breakthrough for survival.

When the author says that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, it sounds like Venus should be our next home. It is not that easy as the author exlplains. Many times NASA has sent spacecrafts to Venus to see what it had to offer. Most crafts became worthless after a short period of time on the planet. Not one spacecraft has landed on Venus in over thirty years. Zero research was able to be done due to the extremes of the planet.

The planet Venus is closer to the sun than Earth resulting in extreme temperatures around 800 degrees on the outer crust of the planet. A thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide cover Venus along with clouds made of sulfuric acid. The atmospheric pressure is also an insane extreme scaling in around ninety times that of Earth. Volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning are all challenges that come along with Venus as well.

NASA has figured out ideas to send a man to study Venus. Though he would be floating 30 miles up from the surface, we would gather more information than we have at the time. MASA is also trying to engineer a spacecraft that will be able to land on the plnaet and last as long as they need or want.

Overall the author shows the strive to gather information on Venus and how it is setting us further in the future than never before. Venus is very dangerous indeed but new ideas and theories are being made everyday trying to conquer what Venus has brought to the table. The author summarizes this as, ""Our travels on Earth any beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",4
78450,"What do you think the face on Mars is? A natural landform or made by aliens? Most people think the so called ""Face on Mars"" is formed by aliens. I believe otherwise because, landforms on Earth are like that and these assumptions are made by conspircy theorist not by NASA officals. now here are my reasons.

The face on Mars is made by natural landforms and not by aliens. One thing of evience by a picture by Mars Global Surveyor, in paragraph 7 it says ""...anxious web surfers we're waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" That's a big piece of evidence that it's not made by aliens. Also, my second piece of evience that supports that the face on Mars is not made by aliens in paragraph 12 is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the Amerian West"". ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That's my first reason I believe that the face on Mars is landform made.

The fact that conspriacy theorist make the assumption of the face on Mars is made by aliens. You have to understand that those remakes are not all true they are just theories which is just provided by evience but, not always right. In paragraph 5 it says ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of like on Mars-evidencd that NASA woud rather hide, say conspiracy theroists."" ""meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" That evidence was never what NASA said that's conpiracy theorist said and it's not true. So, mark these words and think about your decision, i think you should change you're mind about the alien theory to a natural landform with this information.

The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" from the evidence is that it's a landfrom instead of aliens making these faces on Mars. Don't always go by what the internet or media says, go by what real experts say. Maybe, you people that think that it's made by aliens I hope my reasonings and evidence is strong enough to change you're mind. Now what do you think of my evidence did it change your mind?             ",4

Driverless cars can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. What if you have a baby in the car, or perhaps a pregnant woman in labor? These features can help the driver get tasks done while in the car, and still be moving safely as well.

People may ask what if you get bored and fall asleep since your not driving? All models of driverless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windsheild and other heads-up displays. Also GM has devoped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedrstrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acheived with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written to the asumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. But new laws will be needed to cover liability in the case of an accident. If something fails and someone is injures, is it the diver or the manufacturers fault?

Driverless cars are coming into a positive postiton. They can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. That can help drivers at anytime when they are occupying the vehicle. All models are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. The key to a truley driverless car is ahead of us, be we are getting closer, and closer to the destination every day.       ",4

Taking the thought of using this tec. in schools may be able to save lives of children who are feeling depressed sensing the emotions in one and alerting a counsaler or another profetinal to help the child befor the begin to have thoughts of suiside or worse.

Not to mention this tec. could be used in testing or regular class rooms and a way to see if a child is strugoling to pass a test or do there normal work alerting a teacher for help.

Now this may seem unfair to the children cuz some may not want the help but them knowing they will have someone there will make them feel better making them more relaxed and ready to do there work without stress.

This tec. can also be used for security in schools detecting hints of nervas or anctios children with melevolent intent sensing there emotions of there action may be the one way to lower the risk of attacks apon school around the world.

078c66d,"With the advancement in technology in the world we live in today, there should be no surprise of a car with the capabilities to drive itself. Though it does give technology yet another human job, driverless cars should be manufactored. I do not believe they should be maufactored for the average person though. Driverless cars should be manufactored for the blind, elderly, or anybody who does not have the driving capabilities that most have.

Driverless cars should be manufactored for the elderly. Very few people above the age of 70 have the driving capabilites and safety they once did when they were younger. For this reason, a driverless car would be ideal and safe for them to use for transportation. The driverless car would be a safe and effective transportation method for the elderly, this is one reason why driverless car should be manufactored.

Another reason the driverless car should be manufactored is how it will help the fight against drunk driving. With the computer at the wheel, and not the drunk driver, this could prevent from an accident or even a death. Though they could take control of the wheel, the computer system could be capable of recognizing such danger with the sensors, and take over for safety. The driverless car would be good to develop so that it could help in the fight against drunk drivers and other intoxicated drivers.

My final reason that the driverless car should be developed is so that the handicapped could have an easier time with transportation. The blind, the wounded, and the deaf all have their diffuculties with transportation. With the advancement in technology and cars, this would make it easier for them to get from one place to another. With the technology driving for them, they won't have to worry about there disability affecting them. With a safe driverless car developed, the handicapped community would get a better way of transportation.

In conclusion, technology is not always meant for fun. When the technology can greatly improve the life of the eldery or handicapped, it should be developed or used. When the technology can keep other drivers on the road safe from intoxicated driving, it should be developed and used. The driverless car can do all of the above, which is why it should be developed and used.     ",4
078f997,"Many people and other scientists believe that the Face was created by aliens. But, I definitely disagree. First, the Face may be shaped like an actual human being's face, but it's not an actual human being face. Clearly, there's sufficient evidence to prove the Face was not created by aliens. For example, there aren't any alien monuments, and there aren't any aliens! Pictures were taken ten times, to make sure that we got clear vision of the face. Even when picture of the Face appeared on the JPL web site, some people and other scientists, thought the Face looked like a natural landform. That's because a a shadow figure kind of looks like a human face, that doesn't mean it's an actual human. Also, never have I ever seen an alien. Contrary to popular opinion, aliens don't even exist. That's almost saying the aliens are going to take over the world.

Then, I have never heard of aliens creating the Face, knowing aliens creating anything else.

The face is a natural landform because it's just a shadow. Before, when Nasa's viking ship took pictures of the shadow, their camera could have had a bad angle and probably tried to make the shadow look like a real human face.

Next, never have I have heard of a viking ship capturing pictures of any aliens. Or, have I never of anyone capturing pictures of any aliens creating the Face.

In conclusion, I still think that the Face is a human landform because, once again, there aren't any aliens. Also, there aren't any alien monuments. I think everybody is just exageratting about the whole thing. Also, people could just be freaked out about what they had heard. Some could agree with me, or some couldn't. But this is what I believe in, and I'm sticking to it.    ",3
792205,"Dear State Senator,

I think that the Electoral College is important becase it is  a process. The founding fathers established the Eletoral College to the Constitution as a comromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualificatied citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors.

The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President. The counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. The mjority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District  of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ''state'' also refers to the District of Columbia.

The presidential elction is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in

November. One thing that I didn't know is that most states have a ""winner-take-all.""A ""winner-take-all"" is a system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate.    ",1
07952db,"Driverless cars should be developed in the future. Driverless cars could be able to do many things, and could change the world. They would only use half the fuel of today's taxis, offer more flexibity than a bus, and would be much easier for drivers also more enjoyable.

Driverless cars would be much easier for drivers in many ways. Drivers would not have to steer, accelertate, or brake their car, the car would do all of those things on its own. The driver would not have to do any work, unless the car notify the driver when the road requires human skills.

Having an driverless car would create an fun or more enjoyable time while driving. Even though the driver would stil have to watch the road, the driver would enjoy being able to relax in the car without having to drive.

The driver would not get bored, and would be often entertained because, the car would have in-car entertainment and information system. The in-car entertainment and information systems would also be safe because it would use heads-up displays that would turn off when the driver needs to take over.

By having an driverless car, you would not have to spend as much money on fuel because the car would only use half the fuel of todays taxis. I think that is a big improvement because you would not have to worry about having gas because it would not use as much. Also since the car offers more flexibility, you would be able to have more room, and do more things.

In conclusion, driverless cars could improve the world. Driverless cars should be developed in the near future. By having driverless cars, people would save money on gas, it would offer more flexibility, and also be more enjoyable.             ",3

079b107,"Some of the advantages of limiting car usage is definitely that it would help not polute the air. With so many people driving cars in small towns that can quickly polute the air, especially in paris in source two where it says ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partail driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" With all of that pollution it can cause things such as global warming, and unhealthy air for our bodies. With just a small break of not driving the congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog. Also with cold nights and warm days that also causes air to trap car emissions.

Another advantage of not driving cars, would be exercise. That would be such a good work out because you would have no other option except to walk/ride your bikes. You would get to socialize with everyone else who is walking to their jobs, or the grocerey store all while getting a little bit of exercise with your family. With everyone walking and having nothing better to do, sports centers and parks activity has bloomed throughough the city, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up with sales.

More and more people have stopped getting cars/licenses and instead taking the city bus, walking or riding their bike. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If more people would continue to either car pool or find a different way to get where they're going the worlds pollution would definitely begin to go down. Without all of the pollution that comes out of cars and that gets trap into the air, our air would begin to get so much more cleaner and safer for us to breathe.

With all of the money it takes to repair the roads, and the electricity it takes to run all of the stop lights, that money could go towards other things if people didnt drive as much as they do. Although many people need and use their cars for transportation theres always other ways to getting around town. It would also help save you money that is spent on gas every week, with the gas prices being unpredicatable every day.

With all of these advantages of not driving cars as much or at all, it would really help protect the worlds air, and could be a great source of exercise! Walking or riding your bike to wherever you need to go, or even just taking the city bus for two dollars. Also saving your money and spendind it on something else rather than wasting it on gas, or getting your car fixed. Or simply even buying a car, which can cost thousands of dollars.    ",4
079e8bb,"You're living the high life. You have a Driverless Car. What could go wrong? A lot can go wrong. Technology is a grand thing, but it's also a power. If we let it keep accumulating like this we could be in big trouble. Power goes to peoples heads. It's in our nature. We can't let technology over rule us. We need to slow it down. What we have now is grand. What more needs to be done? We don't need to have driverless cars. Soon cars will be like human robots driving wherever they please.

In todays world we have a lot of advanced technology. You watch movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic World. We wonder when will we get that technology? Does it already exist just hidden under out noses? Who really knows. But the point is, is that if we let cars start driving themselves we could get laszy. That's not so good for our social status to the world. Most foreigners already assume we are fat and lazy and get everything handed to us. In some aspects this is true, but with driverless cars on the rise this could get worse.

There's also the fact that what would happen if the car didn't do what it was suppose to do; and it wrecked; and the owner; or a pedestrian got hurt.

This raises a lot of qestions and concerns. The main one would be who was at fault? In paragraph 9 it states that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This is good. Their are a lot of bad drivers in the worlds, but they know what to do in most cases. They know how to take control.

The practice of driveless cars are illegal in most states. Those states being California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. It's good that most states are thinking ahead. Why would something so fascinating and new be illegal to practice? They care about their people, and their safety.

In paragraph 7, it states that there are cars that are partially driverless. One being the 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car is a smart car. It works with the owner not just by itself. The BMW can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but it notifies the owner when it needs human assitance. This is all wrong. Cars shouldn't be doing that. Cars are going to become more human than technology.

In a lot of cases it's okay to have advanced technology. But this is too much. We need to start thinking about what will happen instead of what we will gain out of it. Think of what would go wrong. As the world advances we need to rememeber who exactly is in charge. This is why if we leave technology to do our work, it won't even be us anymore. We will be living in technologies world; not the world we worked so hard to build. This is why we need not let driveless cars come in to existance.           ",3
07a14a5,"The author's claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is closely related to Earth, Venus has a enviroment that is similar to Earth, and scientists want to explore more of what Venus has to offer.

The first claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus is closely related to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars our other planetary neighbors orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner, in space terms, humans have sent numerous to land on this cloud draped world. Each precious mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us"" (Paragraph 2). This supports the author's claim because the author believes that scientists should study Venus because Venus is closely related to Earth.

The second claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus has a similar enviroment to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (Paragraph 3). This supports the author's claim because there are many physical and enviromental dangers that are present on Venus. Despite all of Venus's dangers, scientists still want to explore Venus in depth.

The third claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that the author supports the further exploration of Venus by scientists. In the passage it states,"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option to visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?. NASA has one particulary conpelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vechile hovering over Venus would aviod the unfrendily ground conditions by staying up and out of thier way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy, conditions, but survivable for humans."" (Paragraph 4 and 5). This supports the author's claim because scientists want to know more about Venus's planatery history and similarities to Earth.This statement also supports the author's claim because the scientists wants to try and send humans to Venus.

Therefore, the author's claim supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by Venus being closely related to Earth, Venus has a similar enviorment to Earth, and the author encouriging further explorations to Venus.       ",6

There would not be any traffic jams,or heavy smog,people wont have to worry about gas prices. Our enviroment would be cleaner and better for us to live in. There are so many advantages from limiting car usage.

People with cars tend to worry about gas prices and how much money it takes to fill up their car. When limiting the usage of cars,and walk or bike it helps save your money for something other than gas. Just think of it the average person has to fill up their gas tank at least once every one to two weeks, and if they drive constantly then once every three to five days after they had just filled up their tank. Why even waste gas to go down the street to a store or to a friends when you can use a better and more conservitive type of transportation, its nonsensicle to even drive for a short amount of time if you can walk or bike to you destination. If we also limit car usage we wont have to worry much about bumper to bumper traffic or car accidents. Think of how much much time traffic on the highways wastes sometimes 20 minutes to an hour or two when we can be doing something better with our lives. Not to mention if we limited our usage our roads sidewalks and highways would all change. There would also be more outside attractions to do and be apart of, malls and stores would be different as well considering that if not much cars are around its not necassary to have shopping plaza because not much cars would be parked. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot and change and impact the way we live in a positive way.

Think of our enviroment and ozone for a minute,and how bad the fules that power our cars effect it, not only does the fules effect our enviroment it also affects us too. When we have a high amount of smog in the air due to cars it makes people congested because our air is tainted and polluted. How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid the EPA is promoting the act of reduced car communities. Its not just cars either you have motorcycles as well that harm us and the enviroment ion the same way. Not only will limiting your usage on your car will be better for your wallet it would be better for you as well considering the fact that some people if not using or having a car tend to walk or bike which is exercise and it helps to benifit you out as well as your money. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot. Considering that everyone is out of shape because of our advances in life a little walking or biking exercise will benifit us from being lazy, you can even make your walk fun with music to listen to. If we limit our usage it will help our enviroment and our health as people as well.

Cars maybe needed if you have a job or a place that you need to go that is a far stretch from where you are. Cars are very handy i'll give it that,but sometimes they are unnecessary to use in certain situations. Peolpe like having a car for freedom and having their own transportation instead of relying on something else to get them around, but the thing is that we dont actually need cars that much for things. People are just lazy and depend on cars so they dont have to walk, take a bus ,or bike to their destination but its that mind set that most of us have and thats why our enviroment is getting killed slowly. We need to stop being lazy and think of better ways to get back and forth from certain areas.

Cars can are good to have for self transportation, but there are much better ways to get from place to place without hurting your wallet and your enviroment. There are plenty of benifits from limiting car usage for everyone. When we limit car usage we dont have to worry about gas prices or smog in our enviroment or anything of that nature. Limiting gas makes us better and healthier because we are finding more physical alternative ways for transportation.    ",4
07b6457,"My argument is about how the landform is just a natural occurance. I may have proof to why it may just be another hoax N.A.S.A. may be involved in. If you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the (Face on mars) and you think what!? is that true?. I do not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a increase in technology such as photography. If you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell its not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said.

My personal opinion is that it was just something to get the community aroused and it did indeed. In the passage it said ""It even haunted grocery lines for 25 years!"" and also it played its part in movies and things like that. And only recently in 2010-2016 has there been ANY proof there has been any life or there may be any life there what so ever. The reason of that is they found a river or something I can't exactly remember. And also they (N.A.S.A.) don't believe that there could be any life there because the atmosphere is so hin and so hot they believe that it would be hard for something to grow and live on the planet mars.

Although the cars are tested multipule times, they will never be perfect. Just think about all the new Iphones or other devices that have been upgraded; they still have problems and things that people would like to be improved.

Another reason why I am against driverless cars is because people might have to learn how to drive again. Depending on how the smart cars are made, people might have to go through driving test similar to if u wanted your motorcycle license. There will be lots of new technology, responsibilites, rules, and regulations that come with the smart car. Do ur really think people would want to go through all of those test just to get another car?

The last reason why I disagree with the smart cars is beacuse of safety. The smart car can become a huge safety hazard. In paragragh nine is says,"" Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver control at all times."" This quote shows that the law believes it's safer to have a human in control. It also says,""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This quote explains my biggest consern. If someone or a feamily was severly hurt who would be to blame? Although the car was driving, the driver should be focused at all times no matter what because anything could go wrong within a matter of seconds. Would you really want to put ur family at risk?

I disagree with driverless cars. Driverless cars are very dangerous excpecially of they are not in the right hands. They can malfunction, we could have problems with people not wanting to take all the test just to get a new car, and they put lives at risk. To have a driverless car, you need to be responsible, and mature. Although its fun, it is also risky. Don't put your life or anyones elses life at risk. ",4
07c48b4,"How would I feel about being able to detect somone else's feelings? I honestly believe that it would be helpful to understand someone and what they are going through at that specific time.

My first thought on this opinion is that it must of took a while to actually build this and to think of the idea as to what you could use to figure it all out. When Dr. Paul Eckman built this he must of had to be thinking about other people and the concept of wanting to help others. In pargraph four it proclaims ""By weighing hte differnt units, the software can identitfy mixed emotions"". Dr. Eckman was on the right track building this because any human being can feel up to 3 emotions at once and he knew just that so he figured he would build it be able to detect not just one but mulitple.

In pargraph 5 it says ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial triat that conveys it"". By the arthour of this article I feel like he knows the cainf anf genorosity of being there and helping a friend. This being made is awesome because I don't know about you but most of the times i'm down or angery I don't like to tell people why or event talk about it being I will get even more upset no matter the size of the issue. The FACS is just the answer for helping a friend in need when you know they need the comfort but don't want to say anything.

There is so many good things about this new software that only genius could of thought of. A drama coach once made his kids practice making happy and sad faces due to actually feeling the emotions before they went on to a play. Placed before me in paragraph 9 ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" Did you know that actually listeing to you friends or parents when they say ""put on a happy face"" it may help. Study shows that this actually can make you happy and being happy is more of what we need in this world.

I highly agree with this article and give it a 10/10 considering it is a very kind think to do and not to mention a brillant idea. All the emotions it can detect right down to the percent in unbelieveable. It can take us far ways and may even make the world a better place. Being happy is the number onekey to a great life and everyone deserves that.   ",4

07c7556,"I belive that the development of driverless cars should be continued because they help those who are unaware of whats happening by giving them warnings and automatically stoping on their own.

Driverless cars would be agreat thing for us and even though you have to manually on your own, back in and out of the parking lot or deal with traffic issues, thats still just a small simple task. Lately Google has a modified a car named the Toyota Prius. This car has position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video mounted camera near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor. The most important thing about this car, is that it has a Dubbed LIDAR, which uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. These appliances to a car are very helpful for the driver. It allows them to see whats behind them, sensors that lets the car no when something is coming, and it checks the cars surroundings.

Technology has been producing more and more ways for us to have driverless cars. So far, cars aren't completly driverless yet, but they can steer, accelerate, and brake all by themselves. They are all designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. So, humans still have to be alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires them. GM has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Maufactors are considering adding cameras to watch that drivers are focused on the road. While the driver

watches the road, the car watches the driver,

There are still laws that human driver must be in control at all times. if there are to be an continuation of driverless cars, they will have to make new laws so that they can cover liability.

So driverless cars are still continuing on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Many car companies are planning new things for ther future, like Tesla has a projected in 2016 they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time, and Mercedes- Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that drive themselves by 2020. So, the road to truly driverless cars continues on, and we grow closer and closer to our goal every day for the new age of cars.",4
07ca280,"Dear  State Senator, 1/23/15

I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a

""winner- take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate."" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.

My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is becuase it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?

In conculsion, ""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or  causes many disruptions in our country.

Sincerly, a very patriotic citizen,

07cd836,"One uses a car to go to the store, pick someone up, or even to go shopping, but what if people had no cars? Not having a car would have advantages.

To start with, not having a car helps the enviroment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in th eUnited Stated."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 5). Without cars the air will become cleaner and people won't have all the polution in the air. Our air will get better if we start not having cars.

Also, another advantage is that people will get healthier. No polution gives people healthier air and with no cars people will have to walk everywhere or bike. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular swuare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are bing adopted around the world in attempts to make the suburbs more compact and more accessible to the public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 6). Ones destination will be a walk away not miles. People will just walk, bike, and if their destination is far away one will take public transportaion. One will become more active without cars.

Finally, driving is comming to an end. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the Untied States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (The end of car culture, paragraph 29). Gas cost more, people are getting hurt while texting and driving, and some people just don't know how to drive. People seem to be getting over cars. This could help the enviroment. Driving just isn't a priority.

In conclusion, having no more cars would benifit people. The enviroment will be better and people are getting over cars anyways. Why drive a car that harms the air, when one could simpily walk or ride a bike making one healthier too? Not having cars would help.    ",4
07cde52,"My argument for the development of these cars is against it because i do not agree with some stuff such as the cars driving its self.

If a car drives it's self then it would be no fun for people who have cars. This development is crazy because it will change many things. We should keep cars the way they are instead of changing them to something different that not everyone would like.

Many cars are already having many problems so why make a car that can drive its self? We should fix the problems in todays cars instead of worrying about trying to bring something new. People are putting to much in cars, such as sensors and computer hardware. These things might help but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. However it could be a good idea to always add safety things to the car, but not everything can be sure to always work. Anything can fail at anytime.

Technology is really advanced! Everyday people are working on something new because of how well technology is. If technology keeps on advanving people will make more things and come out with incredible things. Many of these things won't be safe. People have to think in the safety of theres and others. It is not a great idea If you let a car do everything for you because that could be dangerous. You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good.

Other cars like BMW's and Gm have developed mny different things for cars. In the article for example says a BMW has a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car. That's why i am stating my opinion on why i am against the development of these cars. We should stay with what we have until we are 100% sure about things. ",4
07ce28e,"In the age of technology, we are constantly searching for better ways to communiucate to computers. It seems as though they are just blocks of plastic, wiring, and metal that have no empathy, brains, or hearts. But what if computers could understand human emotion? The computer could know what we are feeling and give us results to match that mood. This is becoming a reality for society today, as a new software, the Facial Action Coding System has promising results for understanding and catergorizing human emotions. This technology could be used in the classroom, where it would provide a better learning environment for students if the computer could understand the students and know if they were bored or tired, and would adjust its program accordingly.

The Facial Action Coding System was created by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illnois and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. The FACS first costructs a 3-D model of the face with all 44 face muscles. Movement of one or muscles is called an action unit. Dr. Paul Eckman, another creator of FACS, has ""classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated them with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles."" The FACS was tested on the Mona Lisa, and detected her as ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" A computer being able to understand human emotion would be groundbreaking, as ""most human communication is nonverbal, including, emotional communication."" We as humans have a variety of expressions, from huge ones to very subtle changes in mood. Computers need to understand these, along with the subtle facial movements that go with them. A extensive calculation is needed in order to acheive this goal. We humans perform this 'calculation' every day, as we can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face by taking their facial cues into consideration of their emotion. A comptuter that could a similar thing as such would know when you're happy or sad, and then react accordingly. If you were to smile at a Web ad, it would send a similar one. But if you frowned, the next one would be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Hunag predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would allow for a better learning environment and teaching skills for students.

The use of this technology would be outstanding and unbelievably helpful in the classroom. It could accurately identify a student's emotions and change the lesson plan to meet their own academic needs. This technology not only can identify emotions, but can help humans to react to them. With more expressive characters in video games and movies, humans can identify and repilcate such emotions, as we have empathy. Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions, and computers with the FACS software could allow for that and much more to occur. Technology as we know it today could be changed forever. If computers do acquire the FACS software, then it would be able to identify human emotions and adjust accordingly.",3
07d1a3b,"Living in a world of unusual habits and features would be overbearing and apprehensive for individuals. All people have a structure for their own living while following their beliefs or customs. Human beings have evolved from a variety of settings which has enabled them to create enternal memories or daily habits of their own kind. Individuals studying another environment such as Venus will bring different and numerous facets to their life. People practicing the components of the planet Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the planet's features, the knowledgement that scientists will discover, and the producement of devices.

To begin, Earth is a contrasting planet that isn't identical to any other aspect in space. However, the planet earth and Venus have obtained similar qualites that would result into a much bigger asssumption. Centries ago Venus had acquired oceans that covered the planet just as Earth. According to the passage, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Life forms being a possibilty on Venus protrays that any kind of living such as humans or animals can be capable of surviving on this planet. Even though life has the ability to live on Venus, the only obstacle involved with this theory are the animals and human beings adapting to a new way of living. Moreover, people and animals getting use to their new structure of life on Venus will be able to use the qualities that the planet performs as of today. The passage states, ""Today, Veuns still has a some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar featres such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus having the same facets as Earth represents that life on this planet will destruct and kind of livng. At last, the studying and the consideration of life on Venus will be an enormous movement for the nation.

In conclusion, people practicing the components of Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the planet's features, the knowlegement, and the creation of devices.    ",2

I would like it if you would just keep the Electoral college because it would be so much easier to pick a president then if we the people had to pick the president. If we screw up and pick the wrong president then its our fault, but if you all pick the president it'll be your fault if the president turns out to be good or not. Besides the founding fathers founded the Electoral college so we should keep it just for their sake. Anyway the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors which then when there picked they decide who is the new or repeating President of the United States of America. The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal. If you have a solid regional favorite you go for them states first then you work around to different states to get more Electoral votes but then if you leave that state that was with you all the way then they atomatically switch to the other person that has been campaigning around all the other states and takes your states what are you supposed to do then? The only thing you can do is just go back and try to get your state back..

07d41ed,"The use of the Facial Action Conding System would be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it will detect how the student feels about the task at hand. If it detects that the student is bored it could modify the lesson to make them more awake and begin working on the task at hand. This technology could also help find each students way of learning. For example if one student works hands on and another works by taking notes then the system can mofify both programs to fit their learning style. This technology also could help teachers see if a student understands a topic, and if they see they don't or they are becoming frustrated with it they can modify the lesson. Using this system would be of value to students and schools, because it not only would help students learn but it would also help teacher teach.

If a student is feeling bored with his or her work the Facial Ation Coding System can modify the task at hand and make the student more prone to continue and finish the work. This claim is supported by the article because it says ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This would help the teacher help the student make changes. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This technology not only helps students become more inclined in school work but it also helps teachers

This technology could help find each students way of learning by detecting each facial expression to see if they are inclined in the task at hand. For example, if one student is understanding and enjoying the way a lesson is being taught, the system could modify each of their lessons to fit their way of learning. But if another student doesn't like the way a lesson is being taught the system can test out different styles until the correct one is found. The article supports this by stating ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow."" This example could go for both advertisment and school work. ""If you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system can be used to see if a student is enjoying and understanding a lesson as well as not enjoying and understanding a lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System could help teachers see if a student is understanding a topic or lesson. It could do this by detecting their facial expression then letting the teacher know if changes need to be made. This would help because it allows the teacher to know if thier methods of teaching are acually being of value to the student. This claim is supported because the article includes ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This supports the claim because it shows that the software can identify not only one emotion but serveral. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The technology can analize and detect certain emotions and allow the teacher to see all of them and make modifcations if they are needed.

Using this system would be a value to schools because it not only helps students learn but it would help teachers teach. It would allow teachers to see how certain kids learn and modify their lessons to fit. It would also allow students to be more inclined in the task at hand. This system would be a great value to education and how kis are taught.         ",6
07d6f42,"Technology has been vastly improving these past couple of years. With all these new technological improvements it can also play a major factor in classrooms. All teenagers these days are very ""tech-friendly"". Therefore it would only make sense that we should incorporate some of these technological adavances

into the classroom so students could be more engaged during class. It would greatly improve many homework scores, quiz scores, and even test scores

thus overall having many improvements to their grades in all.

The new software "" Facial Action Coding System"" has been a huge technological improvement to this time.

In the passage it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements---in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotion."" This can show how in a classroom if students are being active during a lesson and participating. Or if they are dozing off somewhere else with the help of this technology then the computer can change its algorithms to change how the lesson is being taught therefore making the student pay attention during class.

In a classroom filled with some kids that just can't focus and/or do not understand then this technology can come into great use. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" the passage states. This technology could help students that have trouble with some classes or just are not paying attention whatsoever, in the passages it also states,

""Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With this technology it can highly improve on keeping the students attention at all times, this can help the students with making sure they know whats going on during class at all times instead of zoning out then missing something very cruical and overall messing alot of things up but instead keeping them highly engaged at all times.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is greatly valuable. The use of this technological advancement would greatly improve students comprehension of some classes in school that they might've not understood before. It would be more personalized to that specific person, the more confused you look the more different ways it would look to make sure you understand the concept. Thus making the student very proactive and improving their overall grade. ",3

07e11fc,"The Face on Mars

There is a great population of people who believe aliens exist and cause strange things to happen and space crafts to appear. Many people know that it is just science fiction and that there is no evidence showing that aliens actually exist. This has been going on for decades and the believers need to face the truth. They can belive as long as they want, but there is no evidence.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform. Meteors and other space rocks strike the planets, and even the moon. Those can be a possible cause of the Face on Mars. With astronauts exploring Mars to see if it is capable of supporting life, the Face could be caused by the humans collecting large amounts of the planet and walking all over it. Aliens are nothing but a fictional character in the many Hollywood movies.

As humans with the sense of sight, we are used to seeing faces on a daily basis. We look at clouds and depict them as something we have seen before. Or a tree that looks like a face was made out of it's bark. It is understandable that you could see a face on Mars because that is human imagination. The Face is just a natural effect of what caused it to happen. Sure, we might not know about everything that goes on in space, but we do know that many people are interested in the fact that Mars may be able to suport life.

Scientist are doing everything they can to know more than enough about Mars. They have rovers and cameras to look at Mars from Earth and be able to study it without traveling all the way there. There are many photos and videos of Mars and what you might see there, but no aliens were found. Their equipment is high quality and no blurs or scratches could be seen as something it's not.

For those who support the belief that aliens roam Mars, they can invest on the discovery, but find it wasteful. The Face is just a landform and you would need evidence to support your alien claim. There are many photos that were taken over time of the Face and the differences could be because of erosion or asteroids. Many things go on in space, but alien activity isn't one of them.  ",3
07e4b76,"Do you think that the ""Face on Mars"" is not a real face but just a natural landform? Well, we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, it rereal that it's just a natural landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were. In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West.

First of all, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surefers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing that it's just a natural landform.

Next, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" Garvin added. ""So, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!""

On the other hand, some people might say that the Mars Orbiter Camera team didn't take the photo cleary than the original Viking photos or they could think that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars but, on April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" said Garvin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Last, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landforms common aroung the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, we think that the ""Face on Mars"" is not a real face but just a natural landform because we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural

landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were. In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West. There were no Alien monument after all. That is why we think that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a nartural landform.",3
07e7133,"Dear Senator,

I am writing you to explain why the Electoral College system of choosing the president should be changed. The president should be chosen based on popular vote instead of the current system. The Electoral College system is unfair to certain states and somewhat confusing to others. I am certain that my views on this issue are not the only ones.

First off, the Electoral College system is unfair to states. Candidates for president don't spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning in. This is due to the Electoral College morphing the states into a winner-takes-all system as said by the Office of the Federal Regiser in ""What is the Electoral College?"". This means that the winning popular vote in each state wins the electoral vote for that state as well. The thing is, however the number of people voting compared to the number of electoral votes is unfair. I am aware that the number of electoral votes comes from the state's population, but imagine this; California, which has 55 electoral votes gets visited by this to-be-president and wins it over only by a small margin. Wyoming, which has 3 electoral votes, doesn't get a visit by this candidate because he thinks that 55 votes is more important than three and a large majority of this state votes against him. The candidate then loses three electoral votes, but wins 55. Sounds like everything works out well right? Wrong. The other half of the voters in California combined with the majority of voters in Wyoming could have taken the vote if it weren't for the Electoral College. With popular vote the candidates would have to actually care about the states like Wyoming instead of ingnoring them with Electoral College. With the popular vote system everyone has a say.

To continue, the Electoral College should be replace because of the confusion it causes. Most people believe that when they vote they are voting for president. However, what they dont know is that they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This slate of electors then votes for who they want to be president, and this might not always be the choice you want. With the popular vote system there would be no confusion and no voting on people who you want to vote for you. Do we really know who we're voting for? Or are we just going on luck? The reason why so many americans do not vote is because they think that even though they vote, they do not have a say on who's gonna win. With the popular vote system we could directly vote on who we belive to be the right choice for president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system should be replaced because with a popular vote system there would be fairness to all states and no confusion on who you're really voting on. With all of this said, I hope you consider my request and try to make a change.

Yours truly,

07e96aa,"The Face on Mars was a mysterious topic for several years. The Face was believed to be an alien monument. However, through research, NASA was able to confirm that the Face is in fact not an alien monument, but instead a natural landform on the surface of mars.

This famous picture has gotten a lot of attention in the media. What some people may not realize is that the photograph was taken through clouds. The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" Some believed alien markings were hidden by the haze, but perhaps the haze was instead covering up detail in the landform that would show that it is not a face, nor an alien monument, but instead just a natural landform. NASA also happened to have technology that could clear up this picture. The technology used to explain this photograph was described by stating, ""You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This shows that NASA has the technology needed to explain this image. After using this technology, the image was revealed. The text claims that the photograph shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. It is also said in the passage that these are common lanforms in the American West. It is clear that this landform is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, and it certainly is no alien monument.

In conclusion, after research, it was releaved that this unknown formation located in Cydonia on Mars had no connection to aliens and instead was a natural land formation, similar to some landforms on Earth.",3
07eb783,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuite all the dangers it presents. Venus is the second planet from our sun .While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous sacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere

However ,perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far abover the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because mot forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere ,rendering standard forms of photgraphy and videography ineffective .

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus .For examle ,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been teted in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weks in such conditions .The thought of devices make a calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our planet .The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys ,mountainsand crater ,Furthermore,recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit ,a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel

In conclusion of the authors suggestion on studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite all the dangers it presents .I think that people should really study Venus and its features that it comes with it does with dangers but you would get a lot out of it just reading this makes you want to go visit Venus.

07f4106,"Facial Action Coding System allows computers around humans to read their emotion based by the look on their face. Dr. Huang tells that this device can tell your emotion because of the muscles in your face and how they are either tightened or relaxed. FACS should be used on students so teachers can help them talk it out, help them understand the material that is being teached and help them learn the emotion of people around them.

Using FACS on students should be allowed. If using FACS in a classroom full of teenagers, a teacher will just see a room filled with hormonal teens. They will just ignore it and think they are just moody. Or a teacher could see how upset a student is and ask if they are okay. This computer could become useful in helping students when they are upset or angry. If could allow the teacher to talk to them and check up on them every once in a while. FACS can detect the six basic emotions such as surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer will detect these emotions through the movement of the muscles.

Teachers can use FACS to help students understand the subject more clearly. Learning and understanding school is very important to young students, they need the knowledge to go and be successful in the future. Teachers want to know if a student is getting confused while listening to a lecture. It is important for teachers to know how to help their students. This computer will help out with the use of studying and scaning how their facial muscles are being moved or how their eyebrows are being lifted.

Knowing how someone around another could help out a lot. If this FACS could really detect human emotions just from the expression on the face and movement of the muscles then it could help a human understand how the person next to them is feeling. Zygomatic major are the muscles that begin in your cheek bones, they life the corners of your mouth. That muscle can determined if someone is giving a forced smile or genuine smile. This could help a person know when another is upset and needs space or if another is in need of comforting. It could also help to see if someone is angry and needs time to cool down.

FACS is able to help people talk out the emotion they are feeling, help them understand material that is being taught to them and help them learn the emotion of people around them. FACS will be able to conclude a feeling of a person and will possibly be able to help someone. Knowing how someone is feeling is very important because then people will know how to appoarch them and how to talk to them. FACS would be very successful in helping others out and it could be used to know a person feels. ",4
07f838d,"I think this technology might be helpful for students, but it could also be a bad thing. It could be good for students becase it would show how they really feel about the work so the teacher would know that their confused, bored, or angry. In the paragraph 3 it talks about what it is capible of in facial recognizion and how it could chage a lesson to better suit a student just by their facial expression. I also believe it could be a bad thing. For example would you like someone to know what you're thinking just by your exepression. Lets say your're talking to a friend of yours and they ask you what you think about their favorite song and you know its their favorite song, but you really don't like it all and you dont want to maybe hurt their feelings by saying what you really think, so you might say "" it's ok"" or ""not my style"". Now think if this technology was out there that you might not be able to do that, and you might not be able to hide how you really feel. That is why I think this technology could be a good thing and a bad thing.",2
07f8601,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens it was a natural land form. There a many reasons that make it seem like the land form could have been made by aliens, but on the other hand there was no signs of any living thing that could have done this. there are many thing with this object that could lead you to beliveing either it was made by aliens.

In 1976 the Vikking took the picture that was bellived to look like a face. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over mars snapping pictuers that were ten times sharper than the first picture of then the first picture taken. By increaseing the sharpness of the picture it showed that it was a land form. The time of year that the first picture was taken it was a cloudy over the Red Planet. This could have made shadow that made the form look like it had eyes and nosie.

The last time the picture was taken (2001) the picture was taken in maximum resolution. This maximum photo if taken of earth you could see the pirimds in Egypt. So if there was anything weird the picture would have shown it.

In conclusion the picture taken in 2001 '' actually shows is the Martin eqivalent of a butte or mesa----landforms common around the American West.''(paragraph 12). All signs are now pointing to the fact that it was a natural landform. In the end NASA found out what it really was and that alines making this figure was false.",3

in my opinon i do not think their should be a machine that could read my emotions ever i belive privacy is important and the will for someone to express their emotions to someone whom they may care about is sometimes sacred or personal varying on the person. technology that tracks the way our muscles move could be used for other puposes the machine can even track if were angry and how our lips tighten around our mouth ,this other ways we could use such as facial recongtion, best said himself "" even though indiviuals showing varying degrees of expression"" these could identify someones facial muscles even if they had face suregy or we could use this as machinery as facial reconstructions benifts .if its able to identify muscles of every unique person even famous art work like the mona lisa then this could have other benifts we could even look into the past to tell how historical figures were feeling in paintings or older photos. or we also could use to know animals emotions and how we can make an animal have a better day or stop animal related accidents from happening such as animal attacks. One good reason is if women could know if how we really felt about that dress the one they asked our opinons about then the trouble comes. often times emotions are the reflection of the human spirit emotions are things that leads rebilons agaimts broken systems or start movements,emotions are what gives us the extra inch for the push, emotions soemtimes give a door to grieve, our even hold our opinons , see we have feelings inside that no one should look threw in todays society alot of mans virutues once held have gone, emotions are something that is deep imside us that we can hold onto , humanity always wants to know even it breaks or passes the limit but , if emotions were able to show they could stop so much possibilties , imagine if slave masters knew their slaves emotions, or britian during the american revoultion knew, emotitons is how cover ourselves .

But the crazy thing is that some people hide their problems away so you realy dont know what they are going through.

As a human bean you know when someone isnt feeling so good or they are feeling so good , and the only they you can do is ask them is they are alright or cool. But the big thing of all I dont think technology can read the emotion expression of people because its an computer and sometime computer be have mistakes and even diffuclts.

811694,"Who doesn't like the idea of sitting back, sipping on your coffee while reading the paper as your car whisk you to your destination? Sadly, as wonderful as it may sound, that is not the case with ""Driverless Cars."" Driverless cars are not really a grand idea as they may seem because even though they say that they are driverless and are suppose to be safe, you must always be alert when driving them, there is a chance that the car maybe unsafe, and without a doubt, they are more than likely going to be expensive.

These suppose driveless cars are said to only handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but it carries sensors that make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. And although the car is designed to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves, it is designed to notify the driver when it requires human skills on a road ahead. Which then require the driver of this ""driverless car"" to be alert at all times and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. This makes the term driverless car pointless.

Having to always be alert while being in a driverless car isn't the worst thing in the world and it isn't the only thing that people have to worry about. In many states they have banned the use of computer driven cars because they believe that humans are the only safe drivers. Although in many cases this may not be true, a human driver seems more truthworthy than a computer that may or may not short circut at any moment. Humans seem to be more reliable but if people ever see to change their minds and laws change, it will still come down to one question as stated in the text, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?

Other than these cars being unsafe, what most people seem to not realize is that these cars are going to probably cost them an arm and a leg. Seeing as how these smarter cars are suppose to be smarter and more high tech. Which leads to the next question, what makes a ""smarter car"" smarter? Well according to the passage Google had modified a car to use position estimating sensors on a left rear whieel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, an intertial motion sensor, and a dubbed LIDAR, not including the things inside the car. This all sounds like materials that cost quite a bit of cash and as time progresses and technology improves, so will the sensors and as things get better, the preformence will go up but so will the value, making the car more expensive to make.

Ultimately, these smarter, driverless cars, don't seem so smart or so driverless because they still require a driver to be alert, they don't seem so safe, and they will probably cost a ton of money. So they require a drivers assistance everytime it can't do anything on its own, making the name driverless car pointless. Another human being would seem more trutworthy behind the wheel than a computer. Then lastly they probbaly cost more than a colege students yearly tuition. Need there be more said about why driverless cars are just a bad idea? ",4
08133fe,"The technology to read a emotional expression is not valuable .Because computer are wrong everyday they are the smarts thing on earth but they still get stuff wrong once in a while . They don't know the true feeling of happy and sad . They just computers .

There millions of reason why it not valuable well for one a person could be looking happy in the picture but be reallly sad emotional . I see it everyday at in the world .Like for explain when someone die and they go to a furel you got to look cool or happy ,but on the inside your heart broken and never be the same . And you take a picture on a computer and it would say you are happen but you really not because computer don't know emontional they just know knowledge .

I mean don't get me wrong it a good tool it see people emotional . But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things .We dont need computer to see people emotional we can tell by the way a person talk . If that person sound like he or she got a additon (come back) that mean that person is in a bad mood and don't want to talk at that time . A computer wouldn't even know he or she in a good mood or not by the way they talk. Another good reason why it's not valuable.

Does computer even have emotional?

I don't think so but they can't tell people emotinal . Compuer don't know what true happence or sadness mean they just tell us whatever they programer put inside them. True happness is something you don't feel its just there . Sadness is somthing thats doesn't feel good something that hurts on the inside.

So yea computer really can't read people expressions just from the face . If it so great im looking in the computer now can you tell me my expression they probably say im sad but im not m just worry . to pass his test so yea computer are not valuable to expression for people emotional ",3

Experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportion bill to be approved.

081b620,"Emotions are sometimes difficult to read. If there is technology that can make reading emotions easier, why be agaisnt it? Using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

The use of this technology can change the preception of schooling. In the artice, Dr. Huang predicts that the classroom computer will be able to modify the lesson when it recognizes a student is becoming confused or bored. This will help students who struggle to understand some class material. The computer can, based on the students emotion, change the way the material is seen, heard, and understood. If a computer can read the emotions of someone who is trying to study, it can alter the way the person studies to make it easier and more enjoyable. This can help graduation rates rise and dropout rates lower.

Some may argue that using this technology isn't fair to the students. That students emotions shouldn't be read by a computer. That to understandable. However, some students are afraid to ask for help because they don't want to be precieved as dumb or unintelligent. With this system, the students emotions will be confidentually read and then used to help the student. Because it can help struggling students, students who have difficults studying, and students who are afraid to voice their confusion, using the Facial Actions Coding System is a valuable tool in classroom..",3
081db56,"I think that the new technology, FACS

which stands for facial action coding system is valuable. Because knowing how others are feeling can help develop stronger relationships and bonds with friends and family. And can also help a person console another person if they are feeling sad, lonely, and angry, even if the other person doesn't show their true emotions/ feelings.

And the technology FACS

can recognize different human emotions such as sadness or happiness even if the person's face doesn't have any emotion or expressions on it.

And we could also learn more on how our emotions change from time to time and why they change.

And could help develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

And it would help people that have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, and other emotions like that.

And it may help with teaching students. Like, say if a person is bored they probably won't learn as much as someone who isn't bored. Or that if someone is confused they don't really learn anything and it doesn't really help them focus either. But someone who isn't confused or isn't bored will likely learn better than those who are confused or bored.

If it is something that the student likes or is intersted it they will likely listen and probably won't be confused nor bored. But if it is something that they don't really like or it isn't interesting to them then they may not pay attention to it and may get bored and/or get confused.

And may help people learn and grow well.

And also if the person learning doesn't really like the lesson or is not interested or is bored or confused then the computer can change the lesson to something that the student will probably like and not be bored or confused with anything on or in the lesson. Or the computer can suggest something else or another lesson for the student to do to see if they do better in the lesson and enjoy it more and focus more.

It can improve education and how well students know everything and can encourage good attitudes and positive things in the present and the future.

Also, it can help encourage people to talk more often and make friends and to also encourage people to help others and things like that.

And maybe advise teachers in a way to make the lesson their teaching more enjoyable and helpful by playing games or letting students have a group of partners to help them and such.

And may help students have better grades/ do better in school and maybe even do better in extra- curricular activities such as sports.

And help student focus on the things they need to do. And help the teachers to make lessons where it will help the students learn better and be more fun for them.

May also inspire people to work harder or more and do different things and come up with new or different ideas and such. And may even motivate the person to do something that they want to do or accomplish.

Possibly even to pursue goals and/ or dreams . And technology can help us with a lot of different things like understanding how things work and other things like that. ",3

Cell phones are a major role to the youth in todays time. that is the main reason for so many recks today so if you give them a car that can drive its self, they are not gone do nothing but text and not pay attention to the rode at all basically if you was to do that you are setting them up fro their own death.

Second ,by not creating these kinds of car and giving them out you could be saving your company alot of money. Because if somebody was to get in a reck and they wasnt driving but the car was driving its self they gone come to the people who made the car because they feel like it was thier fault. Even tho you told them that they still had to pay attention to the rode they not cuz they feel like the car can watch its self. so if you dont put the car on the market you can save your company alont of money and alot of stress.

0821b94,"The world of automotive technology is constanly changing for what engineers believe is the best for society. There are always new and improved ideas for cars, but some of them may not be in the best interest for people. The idea of a car that drives itself seems both unreliable and unrealistic. After reading this passage the idea of a self-driving car seems like more of a hassle than the number one item on a person's Christmas list.

The ""driverless"" cars of today are far from not needing drivers. Most cars, like the Toyota Prius, have many sensors within the car. Though these sensors do help alert the driver if the car is out of control, they do not fix the siuation or get themselves out of it. I have been in a Toyota Prius on a dangerous, icey road, and the car did alert the driver when we were out of control, but the car did not correct the situation it rather made a loud beeping noise and had a flashing signal on the dash. These cars are not driving themselves, but instead relying on the drivers to pay attention to their warnings.

Self-driving cars are also a problem when it comes to legal situations. Dr. Werner Huber believes that entertainment while driving is a great idea for drivers who still need to pay attention to the road. So what happens when a driver is distracted and does not adhere to their self-driving car's warnings? Well the same probelm that occurs with drivers every day. There will still be wrecks and deaths. These cars are not making the roads a safer place, but instead making legal situations more confusing by not knowing who is at fault for an accident.

Though these cars have no large, positive effect on society engineers still continue to work every day on them. These cars are not changing what the base of a car is, but are getting plenty of attention for it. Self-driven cars are unachievable, and they do not benefit society in a positive way.",3
